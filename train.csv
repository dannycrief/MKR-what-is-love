Due-Violinist5278,Lost the love of my life on Monday. Made a video for her to deal w the grief. Our story felt like something out of a movie. Pls watch n share her video. Every view means her smile on one more screen living on. Thnx.,33,13t22zy,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/13t22zy/lost_the_love_of_my_life_on_monday_made_a_video/,2,2023-05-27 08:37:55,love,"We met @ school w about 350 ppl in an auditorium. I had seen her speak and It was love at first sight. She was brilliant and beautiful and nerdy, and sarcastic, and spunky.  I got the courage together to walk up to the podium without permission in front of 350 ppl . And I went to the mic and said.  My names John and I'm madly in love with Victoria Vaughn! Will u go out w me ? The whole place went nuts. I got in trouble and she got embaressed. We were together after that.  Lol we both had issues w addiction. We ended up dating for 3 yrz.   We got sober together, baptized together, and then we got engaged. We had a little tiny 1 bedroom apartment on the ocean in north Florida. And they were the greatest memories of my life. Times were simple. And no one existed on the planet except her and I. We prayed together everyday. And there was a buzz about us, because we kind of knew if we stayed sober, what an incredible team we would make.   She was straight a, very driven and positive person. One of the hardest workers I had ever met.. AND THE ONLY WOMAN MY MOTHER AND DAUGHTER EVER APPROVVED OF...But we relapsed and fell apart. And she ended up moving to Virginia to get away from the drugs and finally b ful time mother to her son. I respected her for that. The plan was, we both get it together, and someday, we find eachother again.   Unbeknownst to us. And after only 4 yrs. She got cirocis of the liver. When she got ill I was luckily sober and begged to b by her side. I texted her and called her everyday. She refused to let me see her in that state. We were expecting  a liver transfer and a long road to recovery. But she passed away on Monday night due to an anuerism and then no brain function.   I made this video to deal w the trauma n grief of being sober and never in 36 yrs feeling this way about a loss. But man am I grateful for the ability. I've lost my father, my little sister, my 2 very best friends, my boss, and my ex gf, and now my ex fiance, all to this disease. Which is why I started the reddit grp  r/sobrietynothercoolsht in the first place.   Here is a video I made to try and express how much I loved her. I sang it to her all the time and I changed out the chorus from  euphoria  to her name  victoria  it always made her smile. Let this b a message. This disease of addiction is running us down, no matter our condition and its slaughtering us. We have a better chance of surviving war, than we do a disease of the mind that perpetuates fear and uncertainty and emotio instability. If u r surviving today. You are a physical tangible, piece of evidence that god exists. And I am here for each and every single one that reads this msg. Dm me anytime. Because there is someone out there that feels this same way about you. Love u guys. https://youtu.be/xBlcMXEGrm8   Incase ur interested. This is the song I recorded for her when she went to Virginia the first time. I made it to try and get her back. It worked. She was back 2 days later. Lol sadly she didn't end up staying. But it helps me to tell the story. It is THE story for me. But yeah here's the 2018  pls come back song  BEWARE EXPLICIT CONTENT https://on.soundcloud.com/9uvpy",1

But after i showed him the post i told him i’m in need of physical touch as my affirmation and we were at a restaurant with my friends having pizza and all through he had his hand over my shoulder holding and squeezing me and I felt so nice. i’ve been tempted to say i love you, but i haven’t .   i’m holding it for when i fully truly mean it because i know how intentional he is, and i don’t want to say anything just because, but i’m really falling hard for him.

I am currently contemplating deleting her on snapchat and just keeping her on instagram and twitter. I dont know i guess on some level i want to stay on mind and make sure she still thinks of me knows she made a mistake. Any advise on wheather i should delete her or keep her?  And any advise in general?,1
Sunapr1,I found my release of loving someone through the stories I write,74,12iha2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/12iha2a/i_found_my_release_of_loving_someone_through_the/,11,2023-04-11 11:49:26,love," For far too long, I wanted to give love so much to someone and receive it as a mid-20;s male. Life doesn't provide you with what you want; more than ever, you have just some pieces you can use to make something out of them. Sometimes the pain of no companionship to who you can give love to is almost unbearable. The pain comes from deep within your heart, cold and throbbing as if your soul is physically hurting, and all you can do is comfort yourself. Self-love helped a little it at least makes me feel so good about myself and brings down the insecurity that I indeed do matter and am capable of receiving love; however, writing stories about the characters filled with the love that I want to give others has been effective. It's allowing me at least to partially fill the void in my heart that I thought I couldn't fill. I have a much easier time celebrating the couple's love for each other, who I encounter daily. The many ways they usually show their love and affection for each other give me so much inspiration for my writing, and I hope that by replicating their love in the story, I can release the large amount of love that I can give to my nonexistent gf",1
UnrequitedPain,How might I (26M) recover from unrequited love with my high school teacher (34F) with whom I haven't spoken for seven years?,0,13idck3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13idck3/how_might_i_26m_recover_from_unrequited_love_with/,16,2023-05-15 16:48:38,relationships,"I attended a private high school somewhere in the US. During my junior year, our school got a new Latin teacher, whom we'll call Jane. I fell tremendously in love with her, but she was both eight years older and married. It still hurts.  I don't know exactly what I want out of this post. I can't afford therapy at the moment, and I'm skeptical any of you will have anything to say that might help me. But I'm at a breaking point, of sorts, and I've never told a single person about most of this, and I just want somebody out there to hear this story so I might feel slightly less alone.  So, this is a throwaway account, because it's extremely private and I don't want anybody to connect it with my main. This is to say that what I'm about to say is not meant to be bragging, because what you think of this anonymous reddit account's academic background does not matter to me. I'm saying this because it's important context: I am extremely smart. I taught myself three languages to the point I knew them better than my teachers in the summers in-between school years, and was helping a professor at a prestigious California university write a textbook on Middle Egyptian Hieroglyphic after my senior year. I got a very rare scholarship to the #1 liberal arts college in the world.  The reason I share this is that it meant that during high school, not a single goddamn student was even remotely interesting to talk to. And I know it may seem difficult to believe after this past paragraph, but I was also attractive, tall, confident, kind, and well-liked. So, when Jane joined the faculty, she and I became friends in a different way from the usual teacher-student relationship.  I want to make it clear at the get-go that she wasn't looking for anything sexual from me - this isn't the story of me trying to get over a pedophile who touched me when I was twelve; it's the story of me trying to get over a woman I fell in love with when I was 17 and she was 25, and who just viewed me as a friend.  We exchanged a thousand long emails in which we just talked about the most random shit you can imagine. We had our off-periods at the same time, and we would spend them alone together in a side-room in the school, or walking by the lake near the campus. I told her about some unusually-awful things I was dealing with at home (schizophrenic older sister had Truman Show delusion, thought I was the only innocent in the family, so I had to feed her every meal and was her only contact with anyone for two years while she lived in the shed behind our house (she refused to live in the main house)), my dreams for the future, my likes and dislikes, my thoughts on everything. She read my favorite books, I watched her favorite TV shows. In the summer between my junior and senior year we met up several times, once at her apartment, to study Sanskrit together. We had nicknames, literally hundreds of inside jokes - if you read one of our old emails or listened to one of our conversations, it would feel like gibberish to you, because we had practically created a new dialect together, a creole of Latin and Greek and English and inside jokes.  She's attractive, but I truly wasn't aiming to have sex with her or anything. I did begin to have a strong wish for any kind of physical contact with her, which I never got, but it was so much more than that. I was just happy near her, and missed her whenever I wasn't. It was, I can see looking back, unhealthily intense.  At one point, I know that several other teachers pulled her aside for a few meetings because they thought our relationship was inappropriate. They didn't know the half of it, but at least in my mind, they were wrong, because we weren't in a physical relationship.  I learned about a year in that she had a husband who was in Britain, and trying to get a green card to come to the US. And then he did, early in my senior year. And our correspondence immediately dropped to a tenth of what it was prior. I began to feel that I had been functioning as a surrogate partner of sorts, filling holes his absence left. And so I was really fucking hurt - I felt, and still feel, grief more strongly than I ever did for a death in the family.  I don't think I hid the hurt very well. She definitely knew I was infatuated with her, even if we never said it out loud. She wrote me a letter wishing me a great college experience and a good life, and to never be a stranger, but that if I got absorbed in my new life at college it was OK, and she understood. Now, for the nearly seven years after we last talked during my freshman year, I've been in a very healthy relationship with someone I truly, deeply love and who loves me back. I'm not dissatisfied with this relationship, except sexually (girlfriend is pretty close to asexual). I've got a life: I run a small bakery, I have cats that I love, and I'm working on an epic fantasy trilogy that I aim to get published one day.  But I'm not recovered. Not really. The pain of seeing Jane every day for my senior year, smiling and joking with her, knowing she was going back to her husband that night and wouldn't have time for me, is absolutely the worst pain I've ever experienced. For a few months at a time, I manage to ignore it - something that was impossible freshman year of college. But, inevitably, I end up having a dream in which she features - last night, I had a dream in which we kissed. And I woke up with heartbreak nearly as bad as eight years ago, and it's derailed my whole day.  A piece of me wants to reach out to her. I don't know whether to just talk to her, because ultimately she genuinely was my best friend, or because I want to tell her that I was in love with her back then. Just so she knows. I haven't reached out to her for seven years because it felt like a betrayal of my current relationship. But the thing is that my love for my girlfriend doesn't seem to have anything to do with my love for Jane - it's not like I have finite love to give, and now it's all taken up by my girlfriend. And I have no intention or delusion of being with Jane - it's impossible, and wrong. But distance and time don't seem to have fixed the wounds inside.  Again, I'm not sure what I'm looking for, here. Whatever you think I need, maybe I do. Thanks for reading this.  TL;DR: Trying to recover from unrequited love, not succeeding.",1

At first everything was so beautiful and I was so happy to be with her. But she have a boy bestie for years and I got to know they are talking to each other by calling babies and I didn’t find it comfortable and at the beginning I told her to tell him that we got together but she refused to tell him and after a fight she told him and as expected he begged her to leave me and love him instead. I told her to keep distance from him as u know his intentions. After some time I confronted him directly for buying her flowers and then I got to know they were in relationship before and she broke up as they keep on fighting. She never told me they were together until then. I let it pass and ask her not to talk to him as he keep on hitting her and it concerns me. She said ok and said she won’t talk to him anymore but I still know she didn’t blocked him or anything as I could still see she’s still following him in insta and he’s still following her, I mean if she blocked him it’ll not show as she’s following na as it blocking unfollows them too. I decided to let it go but still this is bugging my mind, why couldn’t she let him go? I fought so much and I expressed my dislike so many times still she’s refusing to let him go. As we are in long distance relationship it concerns me so much. I love her so much and she loves me too but why to still keep him? I’m so disoriented that I should leave her before a serious heartbreak ? Or still pretend like I believe her ? I don’t even think I trust her . My mind is so fucked up. Kindly help me get through this",1

I'm super thankful for for everyone who took time out of their day to drop their two cents into it. Genuinely, thank you.  I am however, gonna do something that I was absolutely terrified to do, something that really hurts to do, the right thing to do.  I am letting her go.  After giving it some thought, I realized how pointless it is to hold onto any hope, I can't reach out to her and she hasn't reached out to me either. Plus, holding onto someone you hurt is pure and utter agony because all you keep thinking about is what you should've done.  So for her sake and for mine, I'm leaving it all behind.  I love her, but I let fear get the better of me.  Fear, the monster under my bed.  All it has ever done is ruin me and hurt those around me.  Not anymore.  I owe her, which is why I'm gonna do right by her.  I'm gonna be as kind and caring and loving as I can be to those around me.  Because that's what she did for me. It's what she taught me to be.  I hope you're okay. I hope you're happy.  You were the purest, kindest person I knew.  I hope you still are.  I hope you're still as hilarious, smart and incredible as you were.  You gave me life, you gave me purpose.  You gave me hope.  I buried all the memories, those moments we shared together.  I'm so, so sorry.

I'm completely lost and spiralling bad 😭  Okay so for context, I (32/F), I've been with my now husband (37/M) since I was 18. We've been married for almost 9 years and currently trying to have a baby (We miscarried multiple times in a row, most recent being last year) ..   Lately he has seemed off, like I could tell there was something going on in his head but he wasn't talking about it, or hardly looking at me. So last night we came back from my dads house and on the way back, I saw a message to  Baby Girl  (which is what he has me under BTW) AND I saw what appeared to be a draft message that he was writing her, where he called her baby girl and made a comment about  hopefully he didn't keep her up last night  To me that screams affair.. but I've said the same when I've messaged female friends from work too. Although when it's the opposite gender, someone that you know he finds attractive, your mind wanders...He said he went out with a friend from work who he has been with a little lately.. but my mind doubts it all now.   When I confronted him, he said that he wanted me to see it cause he didn't know how to tell me. And that he has been chatting with her since he started as friends, but only started getting confused about his feelings maybe less than 1-2 months ago.. Thats when I started noticing him pulling away from me.. And I tried to ask him what was going on and he wouldn't say.   Now he said he is confused, that he wants me and that I'm the only one for him, but he loves her too.. I should state she is also engaged as well for some time now I believe. He said that he feels like she  see's him  and that I don't. I know him better than literally anyone! I've seen the rift, and tried to talk to him. For the first time today, he actually looked in my eyes and he looked like HE was the one hurting. Like HE was torn. Like he didn't just betray me and refuse to let go of one of the things in our way. He obviously isn't innocent here. But he had a chance to cut it off with her and chose not to... So obviously there is alot to unpack there with him as well..   He isn't here at the moment. When he comes here, I try to get answers from him and I just get more broken each one he gives me. He swore they never met up or anything like that. But I don't know what to believe.   We've been through so fucking much in 14 years. We've lost so much and always seemed to get stronger. Now I could lose it all because of some (what I'm assuming) is an emotional affair? Or something more.   I'm looking for genuine help, not instant divorce messages please 🙏 I'm already thinking about it if it comes to it, but for the most part.. he has been a really great husband. Aside from this issue, & one incident when he was at his lowest (which was one text message calling a girl gorgeous iirc, in which he ended up deleting all socials etc)  We were always so good together. People always compliment us on how amazing we have been as a couple.   I'm so sorry for the essay, but I don't know what to do. Please help 😭  Edit: I stopped trying for a baby as soon as I found out, even before when I noticed the shift in his behaviour. To all the people saying that a baby won't help, I know that. I'm from a broken family and I'm not gunna bring a child into this. Please be kind. I already feel idiotic enough as it is 😢😥  Edit 2: I've not been having sex with him since the behaviour change, nor trying for a baby during this time.  Edit 3: I realised I forgot to mention that he wants to stay together. He is saying he won't leave and that he loves me more and that nothing could compare etc etc... but his actions show otherwise.. I've said I need time away from everything. And I'm not willing to just end up having him resent me if he is forced to get rid of her. And I don't want to resent him for what he has done..   He is dying on that  I've NEVER met up or seen her  hill, and he has been open with some other details about his feelings etc. I have gotten some answers from him, but he just keeps saying that  he loves me and won't leave me, and that nothing will compare to what we have, our history, what weve been through ... Basically textbook behaviour 😮‍💨  Edit : Spelling and grammar.  Edit 4: Guys I need help badly! So it turns out it's my closest work friend all along 😭 I'm meant to be seeing her everyday at work, and we're meant to be having this  men's free girls late lunch  thing tomorrow 😓 What the fuck do I do??? They have been fucking and he is pulling some bullshit about wanting to  adopt  her son. She has been working with us for months.. And IM meant to be having this freaking mad girls date tomorrow with her. What do I do???   What has my life become 😭",1

I have known I love him since April 21st. I’ve never been in this serious of a relationship, my previous relationships felt nothing like this. Even if I’ve known, I didn’t feel the need to tell him until I was ready.   We’re long distance right now because of summer break (2 hours away). We were waiting for him to save enough money to fix his car. Wednesday he said his car would be ready in about 2 weeks. I get home from work Friday, he hasn’t been on his phone so I’m chilling in bed thinking about going to bed a little early. Then he texts me and says “call me”. He told me to check his location. He was in my city.   He lied about when his car was fixed and drove all the way there in the dark and the rain just to see me for a few hours. He drove back 2 hours again, in the dark and the rain at 3:30am, and he worked 8 hours the next day (same day?).   The fact that he did that makes me tear up when I think about it. That was confirmation I’m totally in love with him. If don’t know if maybe I’m just stupid and think my extreme adoration of this man is love. Maybe it’s far too soon. Maybe he doesn’t love me yet.   I picture this man as my forever and always. I never considered marriage or having children before him. He makes me more happy than I have ever been in my entire life.   What if I say it and he can’t say it back yet? It’s not that I truly think he doesn’t love me but it really hasn’t been that long, what if it scares him or something?  EDIT: He came down again, we had a lovely time. Lots of kissing and cuddling and talking. He met my parents. We couldn’t stop saying “I love your eyes” “I love your hair” your face, your body, your smile etc etc. “You’re perfect”. I say these things when I look right in his eyes and he says it to mine. He said he’s obsessed with me. Someone brought up that there’s a difference between infatuation and love and maybe this is just because we LIKE each other so much. But maybe it’s more.   I suppose I should wait either way bc people brought up good points for both sides. I think I’d like to hear him say it because I’ve made all the other first moves lol. But I also know that when that time comes I could say it back and that’s just reassuring to me, vs the anxiety of maybe not hearing it back if I say it first.   Basically, I’m still pretty undecided and since not saying it means I really do nothing maybe that should be it lol.",1

I am autistic too, and I go over therapy every week so I can deal with my feelings and different social situations.   Sometimes I feel that we are doing great as a couple, sometimes I just want the divorce but I can’t ask it since I will not be able to handle the many therapies daily routine for our son, by myself.

We talked about it later, he said he still hasn't figured out what love means to him, and hasn't been mentally very healthy or as emotionally available as he'd like to be due to external circumstances (which is true, things have been a little tough on him).   Now a month later, I know my feelings haven't changed. But he has started being more vulnerable with me, and had been emotionally more available (he said so himself). But now I'm afraid that he might say it back to me at some point, and while I honestly can't wait to hear it (I'm getting very anxious to hear it now, what if he never feels the same way?).. I am scared to say the words again. I felt very hurt and rejected the last time I did say them, and I have never before done that with any guy I've been with, and it took me so much courage to say it out loud. Not hearing it back destroyed my self-confidence and now even if he says it to me, and I very much feel the same way, I don't know if I can ever specifically say those words to his face without breaking down or freaking out. I am terrified of feeling that vulnerable again. I don't want to shut him out now that he is trying so hard to get to where I am.. I know he cares deeply about me, and he's battling his demons everyday just so he can give me more of himself.   I honestly don't know what to do here. We're both very affectionate people physically, and normally have excellent communication. We don't usually shy away from difficult conversations.. but I just don't think I can say those specific words again, and I'm afraid it might hurt him and my relationship.  Tl;dr: I said I love you to my boyfriend, I am yet to hear it back. I think he's getting there and I am afraid of having to say the words again as the last time I did, it felt like my feelings weren't accepted at that moment, like it was thrown in my face, and it made me feel rejected and shattered my confidence. I am afraid that he'll never love me, and if he does, I won't be able to say it again and this will ruin a very good thing.",1

Now, they’ve been texting regularly, she gets invited to a lot of things that should be things just between me and him and just spends a lot of time around him. I feel very insecure and anxious and I have expressed my concerns about their relationship and the fact that he doesn’t do as many things with me as he does with her.

I truly wanted the best for her and the people she cared about. To a much more casual degree,  I know that I still do.  Sadly(or maybe not so sadly), I wasn't able to start a relationship with her, even when I told her how I felt. I personally think there were many more complications between us that made it so it was better we stayed friends. But she probably just didn't see me that way, and that's okay. Strangely enough, I learned something from my time with her.  I learned that I love myself. Or rather that I am capable of loving qualities in myself that others don't. It was so surreal when I finally figured out that the reason I loved this girl so much was because she was  just like me. I so desperately wanted to love myself then, but I think I can now.",1

A little backstory: I have dated this guy on and off for multiple years, but this time it was actually getting serious. However, things started to get weird again; he started ignoring me, would walk past me when he saw me, became distant and avoiding, but some times he would be very cute towards me, called me late at night just to make sure that I got home safe (mostly when I went out on the weekends), give me unexpected shows of love, etc. It was all very confusing.  So one day, I was ranting to my best friend about it and she basically told me to leave him. Mind you, the three of us have been close friends for a very long time. But she started saying that he didn’t deserve me, that he was immature, that it was always the same with him, that I needed someone who would appreciate me for me. And I agreed, but I still wanted to give him a chance. So I did. Almost every day she kept asking me about it and reminding me, when she could, that he was mistreating me (which he was, no one deserves to be ignored for no reason).  Finally, things ended between us after I poured my heart out to him and he promised that he would change for ME, but the next day, it got even worse and he could not even look at me. After that, I really didn’t talk to him and tried to avoid him, just as he had done to me. I was too hurt to even face him.  A few weeks later, we saw each other at a party and he “apologized” and told me that he had really bad commitment issues. And that was that. I cut all kinds of contact with him after it.  In that same party, however, he spent the whole time with my “best friend”, outside and alone who knows doing what. I didn’t really go up to them because I wanted to avoid the whole situation and believed that she was just hanging out with a long time friend.  It has now been around four months and my “best friend” and him have started dating. How did I found out? By another mutual friend of ours when they asked me how I felt about it. Needless to say I had no idea.  Now, my “friend” is poking around, asking why it feels like I’m mad at her. I have not spoken to her about it and it really is not in my plans to do so. I have slowly diminished contact between us, specially now that I’m in a holiday vacation. What do I do now? Am I overreact¡ng?",1

I take them all with welcome grace and no offense. They all show me what's the reality is, and lessons that i should learn. Sorry if this make anyone think that i make myself miserable, i don't intend to do it.   ------ ------  This is a long story,  and I'm not good at expressing myself, so I'll try my best.   We had been in love for 10 years.   I broke Her heart when i was on a business trip for a year. We're apart, i had some ons, and She found out. We broke up. She hated me and swear never want anything related to me anymore.   3 years later and it's today.  I'm still loving Her every moment since then. I've been trying every nice way to get back to be friend with Her and start the relationship again from there. I always dream about Her, 100% everytime I sleep, no less.   I love Her so much that what i want now is just that i can be by Her side as much as possible, support Her physically and spiritually, be a shoulder for Her through good and bad times... things like that. I don't even have any lustful thought. All i want is to bring Her a happy, peaceful, enjoyable life forever. Even if it's a one sided love, i'll accept it as long as i can take good care of Her.  Point is no one believes or feel what i feel, including Her.   She's now saying that She doesn't hate me anymore, but still will never going back in relationship with me. We occasionally meet because we still have mutual friends, and She always try to keep a distance or ignore me during these meetups.  She's now accepting my support whenever She's in need (She doesn't share things with me so I couldn't actively support Her first hand). She said it was because She still want to keep a friendly relationship with good people.   Every now and then, She messages me to remind me that, no matter how better i become, how much support, how much care i send to Her... there's still zero chance that She want to be with me again.  Sometimes She said that when She saw me again, old memories came back and She can't be with me because of that, and She still need more time, a lot more. Sometimes She said that She absolutely have no intention of being with me again, even if it's millions of years.   She said that She now only open for ones that love Her unconditionally, and She doesn't believe that i'm now just simply love Her unconditional. Even though She said that, from some mutual connections, i heard that She's still naive and sometimes fell in trap of smooth talkers. According to them, at least She was lucky that they pull Her out in time. One or two times, She told me that She'd rather get into those kind of things, or falling for jerks, than being back with me.   That hurts. Everything hurts. Typing these words hurt. Knowing i might never get back to Her again hurts. Reading Her messages hurts. But when i can send Her my care and support, it give me power to go through everything, motivation to live and do my best...   ... My mind still going through a lot but i'm out of word to write... And i don't even know what advice i need...",1

It is a powerful demonstration of love and care. Regardless of the geographical distance, a person from across the world has thought about your well-being and genuinely wanted to share their positive energy with you.  This act of reaching out can create a profound impact on individuals, making them feel seen, acknowledged, and connected to something greater than themselves. It instills a sense of belonging and reassurance that the universe itself is extending its love and support to them.  As more and more people join this movement, the hug revolution gains momentum. The ripple effect of these small acts of kindness will spread exponentially, transcending boundaries, cultures, and backgrounds. The power of a single hug and kind words has the potential to create a cascading wave of positivity that transforms the world we live in.  Through this collective effort, we can foster a society built on empathy, compassion, and understanding. People will be reminded of the inherent goodness that exists within each of us, as they experience firsthand the impact their actions can have on others. The barriers that often separate us will crumble, replaced by a genuine desire to uplift and support one another.  The hug revolution will become unstoppable as its message resonates with more hearts and minds. It will remind us that we are all connected, that our words and actions hold the power to shape the world around us. Each hug sent and each word of affirmation shared contributes to the creation of a more loving and inclusive place to live.  So let us embrace this beautiful movement with open arms, spreading love and kindness wherever we go. Together, we can make a difference, one hug at a time, until our entire world is enveloped in a warm and caring embrace.",1

We're struggling on compromising.",1,143j2mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/143j2mx/i_27f_love_fun_adventure_variety_people_my_wife/,5,2023-06-07 17:15:52,relationships," TL;DR: I (27F) have been working in computer related cubicle office jobs that I hate. My wife (23F) is waiting for her residency to be able to work and help financially, therefore currently I am the sole provider. We have been married and living together for a year and a half. I would like to move to a more rural area to work in tourism, a field I would enjoy. My wife is concerned about the economic situation this would put us in, if I would be able to be content, our stability, and having to adapt to a new environment again. These two perspectives have put a strain on us.   My wife and I have been married for a year and a half. She sacrificed everything to come be with me. She came out to her family, and left her friends and culture behind in Brazil to marry and move in with me to Costa Rica where she would have to learn the language and adapt to a new life.  Right now we are in limbo while we wait for her residency to process so she can study and work. She has had to adapt to so much, and she spends most of her time at home alone with our dog taking care of the house and helping prepare my meals for work. She is incredibly strong and always puts me first. I do everything I can to put her needs ahead of mine as well. I want to be as thoughtful of her wants and needs not only because she is the love of my life, but also because of everything she has sacrificed to be with me.  I was forced out of the closet only a few years ago. This is the first time I have lived independently taking care of our own bills and not relying on my parents. This is also my first (and I will do everything in my power to fight for us to work) relationship. We were friends for 3 years before we fell in love. Everything feels right with her, she is my best friend.  I say all this to say we have both had to adapt and learn a lot in a short amount of time. When I was single and living with my parents while studying, I could hop from job to job if I was in one that I did not enjoy. My least favorite jobs were anything related to office work or sales. My favorite job was working outside at self-driven roller coaster greeting guests and helping them have a great time.  Now being the sole provider, i do not have that luxury. I can't think about me, i have to think about us (which is not a problem, I'm just learning how to compromise more and think of someone else besides just me).  The issue is here in the country we live now in Costa Rica, the jobs that make the best livable wage are in the tech/sales/call center sector.   In the last year I have changed jobs 3 times...  First job was tech support. I got physically sick from anxiety.   Second job was tech sales. I got depressed.  Third job is now as a Spanish/English Interpreter at a call center. I enjoy the aspect of helping people. However, i sit in a cubicle for 10 hours a day taking nonstop calls, and i travel by bus 4 hours of the day to and from work.  This last job I can do. Emotionally I'm better. Physically and mentally I'm exhausted from the hours. I can't stand sitting all day having only a 30 minute lunch to pee and eat and rest.  Coming home to her and our dog makes it worth it seeing that they are happy, taken care of, and happy to see me.  The issue is i have always preferred physical work. i am highly extroverted and love to move. Being stuck in a cubicle at a computer all day is my version of purgatory.  My passion would be to work in tourism. However, we would have to move away from where she has settled and feels comfortable the last two years, to a more rural area that is less LGBT welcoming (but safe), and i would make significantly less money than I do now.  She tells me she is scared and tired. She has emotionally supported me tremendously while I've changed all these jobs and gone through bouts of anxiety and depression. Now in this job at least I'm stable. But I'm just...unfulfilled. I feel like a robot that has to turn my mind off and go in automatic mode. She is scared because if we make this move and start this career change in tourism, she fears I will find something else to complain about, something else to be unhappy about (for example, working more hours for less money), and we will not have the money to move back.   She enjoys our life where we are. She loves our neighbors (who love and accept us fully aware that we are a couple) and the location. She is comfortable and has already had to make a big move once. I love changes and new adventures. She likes stability.  I hold a Costa Rican and US citizenship. Therefore another factor is this. We are still waiting on her CR residency since last year, and are told we could be looking at another year before she gets it. After that we will start the process for her US residency so we can go back to the US together to begin studying, working, and building our future together. This could be an additional 2 year wait.  Rather than being miserable an additional 3 years, in my mind what is wrong with living for the present, doing a job that makes less money, but pays the bills. In these rural areas I can look for volunteer work for her that would get her out of the house more. We don't have a vehicle but in this zone it's easier to get around via bicycle than have to depend so much on the bus. I see how this could benefit us both, with our present happiness and our health, as currently we're both very sedentary.  In her mind she prefers the higher paying job so we can enjoy little things outside of paying the bills, like going out to eat every once in a while, enjoying a movie, etc. Where she grew up in Brazil she also grew up humbly. She tells me I'll be more economically frustrated than I already am, but being sincere, I'm fine with my old clothes, not having a car and riding a bike to work, and going out to eat less. I'm fine eating rice and beans every day, working more for less if it's something I truly enjoy. Right now I'm economically frustrated because I work in an area I hate and want to use the spending money for us to at least enjoy something fun on my days off so life isn't just paying the bills and being miserable.  One last concern she has mentioned to me is her concern that I seemingly am unable to be happy, and that our simple life with her and our dog isn't enough for me. I tell her of course she is enough, i would just like to spend my 40 work weeks hours doing something I know I could excel in and love...  I don't want to be in purgatory for another 3 years. But I also know I have tired her with my constant frustrations, anxiety, and sadness, and constantly giving new ideas on what our next move could be while we wait.   Where she grew up, you just did the job you had to do, whether you enjoyed it or not, paid the bills, and enjoyed life outside of work.   In my mind, i know work doesn't have to be your passion, but since we spend so much time there just to survive, isn't it worth it finding something you at least enjoy somewhat? I know I would be so good in tourism, and i don't want to lose this opportunity to grow in something I enjoy while we wait to go to the US and try to begin more profitable careers.  I'm looking for advice. I truly do want to take care of her wants and needs. I want to be an altruistic, steady, dependable partner. I don't want her to worry about me and my constant emotions and our stability. But I also want to work in something I enjoy. However i worry that since I have been so mentally unstable, she could choose to return to Brazil where she has greater stability, despite being in love with me if I can't figure my shit out.  What advice can you give from similar experiences? How can I approach her on this and make her feel safe that I won't complain and be as anxious/frustrated if I'm in work I enjoy? Or do I buckle down, use this as an opportunity to learn how to be steadfast and dependable even while I'm working somewhere I don't enjoy, pay the bills and learn to be reliable and less whiny?   Thank you for your time. We're both learning how to be adults still. But more than anything I want her to be happy.",1

He’s so gentle with me and listens, he talks about his day every night with me. He says I make him happy, and I feel the same. But recently, he started saying things like, “I want to hug you like this tonight, and forever”, or talks about ideas of plans for us in the near future and distant future (like a year from now). He made a joke recently about proposing and it went right over my head until about two minutes later when we laughed it off.

Before the relationship even started the guy (who is also one of my friends) said he was gonna do it for fun because he could and also seemed to want my validation on her, which I found strange.  Things went pretty smoothly for them up untilChristmas break and I was happy for them. However one night on Christmas break he cheated on her twice in one night while she wasn't out. Someone tried to tell her but he quickly shut that down and convinced her it was someone forcing themselves onto him. Another notable incident was about a month afterwards when he got a very long winded message from her, expressing her concerns of how little he was seeing her. He gathered a group of us around the phone and started laughing at the entire message and complaining. (The message was fairly justified) Following that he went to Europe with 18F's cousin (18M) and they stayed with the original guys ex for a week. There is photo evidence of him cuddling his ex and it is unknown (but likely) of whether it went further when they went out on the last night of his stay. (Likely it did as he had said to the other guy the day prior, what do vou think of [exl? Should I? ) He frequently expresses his interest in returning to visit his ex over in Europe this summer. 1 have been contemplating for a while now on how to share the truth and the images are already circulating between a few people that dislike the guy.

I just have had such large growth financially and mentally. This girl and I dated for months, but bad a lifelong friendship & we were friends since we were both toddlers.  I've always had feelings for her and I thought she was my soul mate. We had a lot of plans and goals to complete together, but she acted to play games and left me for another dude.   Obviously it hurt and I am still feeling some sort of betrayal over it. The thing is, she had a baby with that guy. After the whole mess I cut her off completely and she kept trying to be my friend, but I turned my back to her.   I saw her a couple times recently due to some stuff that was going on and we had some conversations on my and her feelings. The thing is I am not the same. I started making high 6 digits a year and I think for somebody my age I am doing very good. I just recently bought a house months ago, I am able to afford the things I like, and I am loving comfortably.   She on the other hand dumped and kicked her boyfriend out. Right after she did that, she called me to tell me she wanted to give it another go. I have issues, ever since she left me I was feeling lonely and I am still attached to her  . But I also do not believe she wants to be with me over her feelings for me, more so because I am successful now. How should I handle things with her? I don't want to be rude, but I do want to know her true intentions.  Tldr: my ex left me for somebody else and settled down. Now that things went south, she got separated and she wants to date me, but I am not so sure I can trust her again.",1
Stan_SH17,How confused can a woman's mind (22F) be to not want to be with the man (22M) she loves?,0,14697ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14697ga/how_confused_can_a_womans_mind_22f_be_to_not_want/,17,2023-06-10 19:45:15,relationship_advice,"It has been a month since my girlfriend (22 F) ended a relationship of 4 and a half years with me (22M). The reason was that he kissed a boy, one of his friends, one day after a fight we had. She is only now acknowledging that she likes him (he doesn't seem to see her as more than a friend), but that she didn't know how to get away from him since acknowledging his feelings for him seemed to feel like if she was a bad person (personally this is a mistake that I can forget). This for being in a relationship with me. It was because of the guilt and distrust that she felt towards herself, that she felt that she did not deserve to be with me and ended the relationship. She already has very low self-esteem and has been feeling insufficient for a long time.   Then we both realized the real reason for the breakup, monotony, lack of emotional communication, exhaustion, personal problems in each other's lives, different priorities, etc.   One of the strongest reasons why she doesn't want to return is because she feels that she should leave our relationship to be a better person, to evolve and face all her fears. It is a sincere concern, for as long as I have known her she has had such concerns. Only now she doesn't seem willing to continue her life like this.     Here the point is that she has not stopped loving me, she likes me, she even shows that she desires me sexually. In our meetings without being dating, to talk about the situation (me talking about how I think it would be a good idea to come back because we can do things differently, and her confused feeling that this is not the right thing to do) we have kissed lots of times and have a nice time together even with the great problem in our minds. That made me think we'd be back, but she seems to try hard not to do it. I feel like she's fighting her desire to want to be with me, and frankly I don't understand why. We were not a toxic relationship, we had problems but really nothing really serious. We hardly had any discussions, I don't understand why she seems so urgent to escape from me, and at the same time she always fails to do so. At first she feigns disinterest and if I go to kiss her she pulls away from her, but eventually we end up doing it.     The case is more complex, but among the emotions she feels are: guilt, confusion, sadness, annoyance, tiredness, fed up, and well, she wants time for herself. She has said that she loves me, but that she needs time to think about her and what she wants. She has said that she doesn't know what might happen in the future, and that's why she can't promise that we can be together. She also asked me for time and space, because seeing us and talking about her made her relapse, as if I were her drug. So I proposed a middle ground and we agreed to make zero contact for two months, while we heal from the emotional wounds of the breakup and at the same time we take care of all the aspects of our life that we neglected.     Another important thing is that my ex-partner is obsessed with being a good student, the breakup happened at the end of the semester and she usually gets emotionally and mentally out of control during these times. She puts everything before her studies and she is capable of not eating or sleeping well. So this experience has been hell for both of us   .  My question is this, why does she try so hard to get over me and hide her clear feelings for me? I'm not a bad person nor have I really hurt him. Why does she feel that she must leave me to grow as a person? I also want to change, and this breakup is helping me a lot, but I don't think it's necessary to separate us. I don't see compelling reasons, I feel that our problems were due to circumstances rather than our compatibility. If we'd had lots of problems, and she'd begged me to change something, to no avail, I would understand. But this could be considered our first crisis as a  couple  in 4.5 years. It is true that she has been dissatisfied with the relationship for some time because of what she mentioned, monotony, insecurities and loss of identity. But is until know thath she is able to say it clearly and that I'm begging to understand it.However I feels that she is now giving up too easily, now that we are barely acknowledging our mistakes.   Why? Will she realize her mistake? How can you love someone and not want to be with him? She seems like she loves me but I'm a monster she must overcome, and I'm not really blind to realize that I'm not. I'm sure I've been a good boyfriend, with shortcomings but nothing really serious. Our relationship is always very stable, very reciprocal and very beautiful. I am very puzzled. What should I do? Respect the time? Show her something different? Talk to her? Forget her?     TLDR: Why is my ex-girlfriend so determined to move on, when she clearly loves me and there's no real reason to cut me out of her life? When our relationship has always been very good, when now we can learn to improve many of our shortcomings. Why does she see everything so lost? Is maybe her confusion temporary? Is even posible to have such confusion? What should I do, what should expect of this situation? I dont know what to think or if should have hope on her fellings for me.",1

I ask because my partner and I have been going through a rough patch as of late. I am very much convinced that he is the one for me, but that maybe we need some time apart to be better for one another. That’s a whole other story though. Anyway, because of our constant fighting, it has led us to both say some things that are hurtful and regrettable. That includes me at one point hitting my breaking point and telling him I hated him.   Now I know I don’t hate him, I actually love him deeply but I do hate the way he talks to me or treats me at times. He is not a bad person overall we have just been under A LOT of stress and sadly we have sometimes taken it out on each other. I always apologize if I say something hurtful or mean shortly thereafter but he seems to hold on when I have said I hated him. I tried to explain how I don’t hate him, I hated his words or behavior but I have always said that there’s a thin line between love and hate, which he fully disagrees on. I think because both require intensity/passion that if you feel wronged or betrayed, it’s a switch that can be easily flipped. What are your thoughts?",1

And here\`s how it feels:  I look at her while she does the simplest things, like - tie her shoes, put the dish away, check her calendar or anything else and I think to myself - how beautifully she moves. Every single of her movements seem beautiful to me.  I look at her eyes and eyelashes when she\`s looking at something and I observe how her pupils dilate and how her eyelashes touch her face when she closes her eyes and it seems almost magical to me.  I look at her wile she\`s sleeping peacefully and I think to myself - she is the most beautiful person I\`ve seen in my life, no one can compete with her in my eyes. No models, actresses or beauty queens can compete with her in my eyes. I look at her and I know wouldn\`t change not even one hair on her head for anything else in the world. I look at her sleeping so peaceful and vulnerable and I want to take her in my arms to protect her from everything, starting from a bad dream and ending with the whole world.  I look how she acts around animals and kids and elders and people in general and I think to myself - she is the most beautiful soul I have ever met. She shines such a bright light from inside that it\`s impossible not to love her heart.  I look at her when she\`s hurting and my heart breaks because it feels like what\`s been done to her, it has been done to me too. I feel it in every bone and in every muscle I have. And I immediately know I\`ll do absolutely everything possible to make that pain go away and not come back. I\`ll even try everything impossible again and again and again and never give up trying just to make sure she\`s safe and peaceful and happy.  She looks at me with her beautiful big almost black eyes, smiles and says: “I love you” and my heart melts and I think: “What did I do to deserve such an amazing human being loving me?”. And it motivates me to be better, to do better. Her good heart motivates me to be a better person.  When she does something that I could be possibly be mad about, I stop myself and think - it\`s such a tiny thing that could potentially annoy me, why would I hurt her feelings by pouring my anger out on her? I will forget about my little anger in 15 minutes but the scar in her heart that was created by my anger will stay for a long time. She\`s too beautiful of a soul to do that to her.  When I don\`t agree with her opinion, I respect our differences. I remind myself that I\`m not a guru of the life, my opinion is not the only correct one. I might also be the one who is totally wrong.  As soon as I get the urge to yell at her or say something hurtful to her, I feel a sharp pain in my heart even before I have said anything. Because I know it is exactly how she will feel if I say those things to her. And I just keep my mouth shut and rethink what the hell is wrong with me to be wanting to hurt her that way.  After going to bed late, I get up at 6am quite a while before she gets up for work, to take the dog out for a walk and make her breakfast just to let her sleep a couple more hours and feel rested and good an taken care of.  This is just a small shallow part of what it feels like to love someone. As I said at the beginning - you can also be in love with someone but not love them. You can want to be with them all the time but you will not think about how your words or actions could hurt them. You will not think forward about potential results of your actions. You can feel attracted to them but won\`t put them first, before yourself (without feeling obliged to do so and without whining about it inside).  Being in love is not a choice. But to love someone - that on the contrary, is your choice. It\`s your choice of your actions, words, decisions towards your partner.",1

I like to think that I deserve someone of her quality because I'm a decent guy, I would like my partners to think that they also deserve to have someone of my quality (whatever that is) because if they don't, I'm gonna doubt if they really deserve me or not.  So I explained all this to her and she defended herself like every other partner before her did  I'm just lucky we met, that you are a great person, I think I deserve you.  etc. etc. but she added something that no one ever said before, she said  I'm sure all your previous partners meant it the way I meant it.  and it just really hit me. She could have put the others down to reinforce her arguments (some did) or just not mention them, instead, she wanted me to feel good about my past relationships, feel that I was loved by others as well. And wow, I don't think anyone ever made me feel retroactively good like this before. She said something like this even though she is a moderately jealous person. One's gotta be really mature to be able to say something like this, I know I could never say anything like this, but I know I'm going to try from now on.  ps. reading the first paragraph, I realized I kind of sound full of myself but I'm not, it's just my wording that makes it sound like I am, english is not my main language sorry!",1

We have been together for two years now. To get to the point- I am feeling like I am burden rather than a partner. I don’t feel like when we first got together and I’m tired of going back and forth in my head about if he really loves me. He used to tell me every day he loves me and that he was so happy that he found the perfect person for him, as did I. I understand the “honeymoon phase” of a relationship But this is a complete 180 of who I met and fell in love with. I do everything for him- cook, clean, take care of all three dogs (one being mine I brought with me the other two are his), make coffee every morning before he goes to work at 2 am, pack his lunch every day, laundry folded and put away, take out the trash. And I do that because I genuinely care and appreciate what he does for me (moving me in, he pays all of the bills except for my cell phone and occasional groceries) I am a teacher (year round) 40 hours a week and he works 70+ hours a week. He doesn’t kiss me when he gets home anymore, he doesn’t tell me he loves me unless I say it first, he tells me that I need to do xyz at the house, he tells me I need to stop talking to this person or that person because it’s a waste of time. He told me that he wanted to have kids, now he doesn’t know if he does which is a huge issue for me as I’m 32. When I bring it up he just says he doesn’t mean he doesn’t want kids, he just doesn’t know when. I feel incredibly invalidated in what I do and he likes to remind me of what all he does for me. He isn’t the same person I started dating. He has become mean and makes me feel unimportant in his life. It’s like I was roped in, fell in love and it was all a façade. I don’t know what to do. I have talked to him about my feelings but again, I feel invalidated and he changes for a few days and then goes right back to what he has become. He tells me he loves me and wants us to work out, he is stressed at work etc… I am lost and want things to change. I don’t want to be in another unhappy relationship.  TL;DR!

Whenever I see or hear of people flourishing in their younger years it makes me feel a lot of anguish. I never experienced the innocence, pain, and intensity that young, first love brings. My brother brought up asking a girl out to formal and although I'm proud of him, it made me sad. Imagine having the excitement, time and energy of a teenager when you go through first love... I wanted love so badly then but my parents monitored me like drones, were abusive and very controlling (until I actually fought for myself).  I can't watch stuff or listen to media with young love in it. It hurts listening to song lyrics reminiscing prom, or the first kiss, the first anything. It's almost impossible to avoid entirely for me. I used to watch anime in high school but I can't even have fun watching that anymore, because most of it is centred around young people in high school. Before it used to be a dream to live up to, now it's just dissapointment with how my life went.  I have a girlfriend, my first. We have been together since we were 22, and now we are 25. She had a first before me, and she was somewhat over romance and self discovery when we met and just wanted peace. We did have a honeymoon period, and we did go crazy for a bit, it was beautiful, but it all settled too quickly for me. She has great character and cares for me deeply, I don't want to let that go.   But I must admit that when she opened up about her older relationship, it hurt like hell. Not because of jealousy of the other guy but because I wish I had experienced something like that with someone, ideally with her but I guess it's not possible anymore. We had a lot of experiences they didn't have like travel, and crazy sex... But I wish we were still full of life when we met to learn about life together.

Our relationship had ups and downs, mainly caused by the stress of life ($, depression), but we have always been good partners. We always talk through stuff and support each other.  A couple of weeks ago, I had a work conference and met a coworker from another state. There was definitely interest from both sides, and we kept flirting, and that was it. After the conference, we continued texting, and the tone was very flirty. It made me feel good. I know my husband loves me but he is not one to put me up or give me compliments and i have self-esteem issues besides just hitting 43, so feeling wanted was good and actually help me feel more confident with my husband too. Well, my husband got suspicious and got a way to find out who I've been texting (we share a family plan).and confronted me. I admitted to it, of course. I explained to him why, as stupid as it sounds now. I really do regret it and did feel guilty during the exchanges but it was always easy to brush it off in my mimd because nothing physical happened, because the guy lives in another state and because it was really just to make me feel good about myself. It kinda worked like porn for me. I take full responsibility for jeopardizing my relationship over something so stupid, and i know i will have to work to gain back my husband's trust. There are 2 things im coming here for (no need to tell me im horrible. I know that already) I want advice from people who have been on any of the sides. How i can support him effectively and what he may be needing from me? Also, and perhaps more important for us to move past this - I can not prove that I did not sleep with the guy, and I really didn't. But my husband is convinced i did, understandable of course. Is there anything I can say or do to prove I did not?   Edit: The best part of all this is reading all the comments day later is that we are together still, planning a vow renewal and talking about our future together. We talked, and I offered and gave him all he needed, and we are working through it. No counseling is needed. There is still work to do on my end, but we love each other, and he understands I made a mistake that I regret, and i know I have to gain his trust again. When I came here, it was for advice. It was not to hear i did not do something awful. Judging is not advice, though. I do feel bad for every one who just said I was awful and nothing can be done because that is how they see their own relationships and one day, their partner will also make a mistake or they will.

Yesterday I was working and his computer was making notification sounds nonstop so I went to turn off the notification. I then saw his text history with his friend on the computer. It pretty much says he doesn’t feel loved and the friend suggested that he breaks up this month and he agreed. This text happened a few days ago. I admit it was my bad snooping but the friend was sending inappropriate content so I scrolled up to read more.  I was in shock because there was no indication at all. Bf is very sweet and loving in person. Yesterday he went all the way out to get my favorite food and snacks and surprised me with it. He is helping me with my small business and providing great ideas. He talked about planning a summer vacation with me and was looking at tickets last night. We also have a trip planned with his extended family to a beach in a month. We hug, kiss, cuddle, joke around at home as always.  Now I’m not sure what to think - if he’s planning to break up, why has he acted the same and even wants to make plans? Should I confront him? Or bring up the topic without admitting that I looked at the texts? I’m just shocked that someone could be so two-faced. I know that he is the type that has decision paralysis and always has cold feet and second thoughts when trying out a new thing (school, job, even buying an expensive device). I think I’d like to have an honest conversation but I am now feeling very insecure and betrayed.",1

We hit it off almost immediately and a month later we were officially dating.  He lives a few states away (<20 hour drive) but we both try to see each other twice a year since we have been together (for our anniversary and for one of our bday’s).  He was my first everything and I was his first boyfriend.  We were both new to this and tried to be as good at communicating as we could, and for the most part we have gotten by just fine.  However, I have felt myself drifting away from him emotionally for the past half year.  This culminated in a conversation a few days ago where he told me that he thought I was “the one for him” and he wanted to spend “the rest of his life with me” and I realized I did not feel the same way.  I love him as a person, as a friend, but not as a romantic partner.  When we have been able to see each other it has been great, it was amazing, but so much of our relationship leaves me feeling so alone while still being “taken.”  I have talked to him about how I felt a few months ago (~3 give or take a couple of weeks) and he wanted to make it work and I have done my best to do my part too.  We still spend time together and try to do something every other night, work and friends permitting, and I still say I love you in the hope that if I say it enough I’ll feel that way too.  It hasn’t helped at all.  I know he will be crushed, and I care incredibly deeply about him, so I would like some advice.  How do you reignite that spark in a relationship and, failing that, how do you even begin a conversation with someone telling them that you want to break up?   TL;DR: I (24M) am in a 3-year long-distance relationship with my bf (25M) but I don’t feel the same love for him that he feels about me.  What can I do to maybe find that love again and, failing that, how do you even broach the topic of breaking up with someone?",1

The truth is I fell in love with him the day we met and I am so glad I waited.   During a period of time when we were friends I was going through one of the worst times in my life. I don't want to get into details but it got really bad, to the point that I really thought I wouldn't make it out alive and I was in such despair that I didn't really care.  No matter the reason, he was ALWAYS there for me, he was the only person I felt completely safe with from the start, and is the only friend/person I've ever felt afraid of losing. To be honest to try to explain just how much he means to me, for always being there, for telling me things no one ever has before, for being so disgustingly good of a person, someone who turned my life around and continues to be alongside me supporting my growth and progress, and has nothing but endless support and patience while I heal, it's impossible. Just by existing and being himself he shows me everyday, in the sweetest and most natural way how much he cares for me, how much he loves me and tells me with the truest sincerity everything he likes about me, completely unprompted. I feel grateful to be alive because I know him.   I have grown up being severely traumatized in various ways, I grew up with an extremely demanding family, perfectionist and overprotective parents, moved around too much to ever be able to build real friendships or have a consistent support group. I had very difficult times at school, and eventually my self esteem floored. Ever since I've moved out and been trying to become fully independent, I've been on a journey to break in a healthy way all those toxic bonds and attachments to my family, but it's a slow and painful process when completely breaking away from them is not an option.  My boyfriend is the first person in my entirely life that has made me feel like I could be loved just the way I am, and is thanks to him that I want to be the best version of myself and not what others want me to be. I've learned to see the world in a way I never thought was possible, and most importantly, I've learned a lot about myself. He has taught me to see the good and beauty of everything and everyday, and that life is truly beautiful, and it's okay if sometimes we are tired and need a break, and being lazy sometimes is not being a failure, it's just being human in a modern world that grows less and less compassionate.   Yesterday was the first time he saw me  dress up , wear a little make up and do my hair for my graduation pictures. He was gonna take them, and he was with me while I got ready. I am still very insecure about the way I look, and I was very stressed about looking good for the pictures, I was very anxious about some  advice  I was given by a relative who takes it personally and sees it as disrespectful for me to not do exactly as  advised .  Dolling up  has just never been my thing, and my anxiety was over the roof because I wanted to look good enough to prevent my relatives from criticizing the way I looked in them, and it has been drilled in my head to please my family no matter the cost. But my boyfriend reminded me in the kindest way that the pictures are for me, and I should look the way I want in them, because my family's opinion does not define my worth.  So we went, and when we were done while walking to the car he casually said  you looked really beautiful today  ..  I think you are most beautiful at all times though  How could I ever resist him. I didn't know I could be treated so well, I never knew what love was until I met him.. and he is the most beautiful person I've ever met, and I am so grateful and feel so fortunate that I get to love such a person and be by his side.",1

I told him that I was in love with two people at the same time once. He was of the firm opinion that this is impossible. He said that means I haven't found true love and didn't love either of them. It was just friendship and lust or something. I mean, to me it certainly felt like true love. But then of course it's hard to know for sure. Feelings are subjective. Maybe some people can experience a totally different level of love that others never achieve so they don't talk about the same thing when they talk about true love?   What do you say?

I’m  married to my wonderful husband. We’re separated as of now but still married legally. At first, we decided to take a break, but we’re broken up right now. Even with everything going on, I don’t have a single negative bone in my body towards him. I just can’t, he’s so amazing and treated me like I was royalty. He did everything for me and was the best husband anyone could ever ask for. I wasn’t being fair to him, I wasn’t taking care of him like he was taking care of me, I was being selfish and wanted him to care for me all of the time. I shouldn’t have been that way.   In the month that we’ve been apart, I’ve grown a lot and realized how horrible I was to him. I was not a good partner. I don’t want to defend myself, or try to make myself look good at all. I had BPD episodes almost everyday and he had to care for me through all of them. He didn’t deserve that. He didn’t deserve any of that. I’m so mad at myself for not realizing sooner that he was suffering and in pain. I never want him to feel that way again, I don’t ever want to put him through any of that again. If he ever were to want to stay husbands, I’d do everything in my power to make sure we’re healthy. That everything is fair. He deserves to be loved and to be happy, I’ve seriously never met ANYONE like him. He’s ridiculously handsome, he loves cowboy attire, he’s so funny, he has the best smile, and his laugh.. it’s so perfect. He’s the definition of perfect. He’s moving on, and I totally understand that. After everything I did, I completely understand. I can’t, though. I’ve tried really hard, I’ve tried letting go. But, how can I let go of someone who I truly believe is my soulmate?   He was there through everything, he always pops back up in my life and I am so grateful I met him. My love for him is so intense and I would marry him over and over again. He just got a job and I am SO proud of him. He’s doing so amazing, he’s taking such great care of himself and he made time to play a video game with me the other day. I hope that where ever he goes in life people treat him with kindness and love. I hope the universe is gentle with him and welcomes him with open arms. This man means so much to me, I am so in love and I can’t stop loving him. I don’t want to stop. I wonder how he’s doing everyday. I hope he’s getting better. I love him with every last bit of life in me.  I want to grow old with him. I miss holding onto his arm in the car. I miss everything about him. I would give everything to hold his hand or kiss him again.    TLDR; I just really love this man.",1

We have been married for 10 years, have 2 kids together, both work and until recently have been in a high demand religion. She has a history of having emotional affairs (I call them that she doesn’t) with other men and earlier in the week I discovered texts she deleted. Nothing too bad but still hurting with the fact she’s hiding them and not being truthful.   My work schedule is working 2 jobs in the same industry with 2 sleep over shifts in the mix each week. When I am on a night shift I make sure the kids lunches are packed, clothes ready and if I have time (I usually make time) I make sure the house is tidy. I work this much because we have 2 mortgages currently and are attempting to sell one of our properties to cancel both loans out. But with how the current state of rates are in my country I have to work to provide.   When she asks me to do something I do it. I always attempt to put her and the kids first. I’m ok with her going on trips with the kids or with friends. She’s a teacher so gets a lot of time off. I won’t lie, I get resentful of the time she gets to do her own thing.   As a matter of reference a normal day for us is she gets up at 4:30, exercises until 7 (this includes a bike ride, running and gym routine) she gets herself ready and she’s out the door at 7:30/8 - I get the kids to school then go to work. She will get home from around 4:30 - do another exercise session or sport train. If I’m on a night shift she will most of the time take the kids to her mums for a sleep over so she can do her routine without worrying about the kids. My days are usually get up with the kids, het them ready and off to school - work till 3:30, back home and do house work and what not till kids are in bed. Once a week I make sure I am in bed with my wife when she goes to bed - this is hard because she’s in bed at 8:30/9 and I’m not normally ready for sleep until 11 so I stay in bed because that is a request she has asked for - if not I’m in my workshop working on my hobby - only after people are in bed and I’m not needed.  Now to the incident that I’m trying to navigate. 3 nights ago I found some texts she had hid and this set me into a negative spiral. I told her I was having gut feelings something was up and that I wasn’t happy. Went for a walk together and had a conversation about what was going on (I did not share that I knew there was messages) - she denied anything going on. But she ended up telling me in a round about way is this - she is depressed, suicidal and is falling out of love with me. She floated the idea of couples counselling but it was me who said if it’s her mental health that’s causing this she needs to seek help for herself first.    Over the next couple days mixed messages have been coming my way, one message I get is “I’m sorry for hurting you, I could never hate you” to “I don’t want a bunch of questions”   She’s gone away this weekend with a female friend and hers and our kids. Leaving me to stay and work and come home to an empty house. Not knowing where I stand and feeling lost. I’ve had a massive mixture of feelings, from anxiety to depression to attempting to be headstrong and practical in my thoughts.  I know it’s a lot spewed onto the screen here - I guess I needed a vent and possibly some ideas from you guys on what I have missed? Where am I wrong? What can I do to fix my part in this?   TLDR - Marriage of 10 years is on life support due to wife falling out of love with me and there being some questionable behaviours.  Update 1 - Short text Exchange  Her: I don’t hate you. I care about you so much. This is really hard for me. I know it is hard for you too. I feel like it didn’t matter what I did or do- I couldn’t make you happy. I didn’t fell happy. I have been feeling lost and so very depressed.  You do the best you can… and I love and appreciate you for all of that. I really do.  But how can we keep going on that track? Where we are almost always in competition for who feels the worst- who has it the hardest- who is the most unhappy. Truth is- we were both unhappy more than we were happy and that isn’t how it should be. Please correct me if I have that wrong  Me: Are you telling me you want to call it?   Her: I am asking if you agree with what I have said  Me: I agree but I think there is something you’re missing. I was craving time with you, your attention, your affection, your time….   Her: That craving went both ways. What didn’t line up was our other commitments and hobbies.   Me: Tell me what you’re wanting now. Do I need to not be here on Monday when you come back?  Her: Nothing has changed since I left. I am still wanting to do what I said I would  Me: But what does that mean for us??? Are we just room mates? Are you still my wife?   Her: I am your wife. I won’t change that till or if- I can’t get happiness even when I am feeling better within myself. Is that ok? If it is too hard- then we just try something different  Me: For me I just don’t know how you want me to be toward you - can you understand why I’m finding this difficult to navigate   Her: Yes I do understand. It is difficult to navigate- be however you want to be. Don’t have to make it complicated more than it is  Me: The reason why this is hard is because you’re not giving me a clear outline on what you want from me right now.   Her: I want to be given time and space when I need it- to be able to work out myself. I don’t want any more drama dumped on my plate.   Me: I understand you need space for your mental health, but what does these mean in practice? Is that you being able to set the relationship aside whenever you need? And by drama you mean issues from me?   Her: I need your support. I wouldn’t say - set the relationship aside- it is more time and space in a physical sense…. Like having moments where I can go for a walk and clear my thoughts- without worrying about the amounts of stuff I have to do. Dramas- are from everything in all aspects.  I gotta sleep. I am really tired   Me: I already do what I can to make things easier for you here. I already never stop you from going and doing what you want to do. I’ll keep my issues to myself.   Her: I appreciate all of this, I value what you do for me And the family. Will talk tomorrow. Goodnight",1

So let’s start from the beginning  So the father of my child (23M) we will call Matt, and I (F23) met in 2019 when we were both 19 at a concert after i approached him because I thought he was cute and asked for his Snapchat. We hit things off pretty well and spent our summer together, going on dates and partying together. Towards the end of the summer Matt really wanted me to meet his mother but I was scared of commitment and being a 19 year old wasn’t quite ready for a relationship so we stopped talking that year.  In 2020 we were on and off and would hangout occasionally. Until the end of 2020 he started a new relationship with his daughters mother we’ll call Dani. Dani and him ended up having their daughter in 2021 in which at this time I respected the relationship and we stopped talking and continued on with life. Fast forward to April 2022 Matt and Dani has since broken up and I ran into Matt again at a party and we hit things off again and started talking and hanging out. Matt and I would spend everyday together since, and I stated to Matt when we started talking again that I wasn’t on any birth control just to be clear. Soon in July of 2022 Matt and I started dating officially and in august of 2022 I found out I was pregnant with our son. I was scared to tell Matt because things happened pretty quickly but he was excited and told him family right away we were expecting.  We were excited and scared at the same time, we went to my doctor to confirm the pregnancy and started to plan things out and moved in together.  To some up my pregnancy Matt cheated on me my entire pregnancy and it took a toll on my mental health and well being. Matt would lie and leave Dani and his daughter with me at our house while he would go out and cheat. I was really depressed as he would constantly cheat and lie to me about where he was and always texting other females/liking half naked photos of women and following women that have onlyfans.  Fast forward to tonight June 2023 my son is currently 2 months old. Matt’s younger sister and I really bonded together and talk often. Tonight Matt’s sister told me that in the car she heard Matt speaking with their mother saying he didn’t love me nor his son as much as his daughter. Feeling hurt I wanted to confirm this with Matt so I confronted him about his feelings toward me and our son which I was already suspecting because he never gives us attention on the days he has his daughter and never shows me love or affection anymore. He treats me quite badly and makes remarks about my body even though I just had his son, and never likes to spend time with me anymore. And to my surprise, Matt went on to confess that he never loved me, and when I was 5 months pregnant he found out I had a onlyfans account before we got together which is since been deleted, and stated that he would never have been with me if he knew I had a only fans account and would’ve told me to abort our son if he have known…which isn’t fair considering he follows bunch of onlyfans models on instagram. And basically said that he loves his daughter more than his son because she’s a female and that our son needs to be a man and said he’s a crybaby considering our son is only 2 months old of course he’s a baby that’s gonna cry! Matt told me he could care less about what me and my son do, and told us we can leave and move somewhere else if we want. Basically dismissing us and said he will just pay child support and leave it at that. I’m currently packing my son and I things and staying with my cousin. I am so hurt and betrayed by his words. We have been together for a year and spent almost everyday together. I have laid next to this man in bed, ate dinner together, had his child, shower together, make love together everything…just for him to tell me he never loved me at all. I am so hurt. What do I do with this information?  TL;DR The father of my child admitted to never loving me and our son because I use to have a onlyfans before we started dating",1

I had actually assumed he knew I was 18 because he held my driver's licence for me when we were waiting to leave the course. So no, I was not groomed, I just wanna put that out there.  We got married pretty quickly and I gave birth to our daughter when I was 20. I gained a lot of weight that I've only recently lost, and I was trying on all my old clothes to see what fit. My husband was with me when I was doing this. I found some of my clothes from my teens, and I make a comment about how my clothing (and makeup) style has become much more conservative. My husband then said 'yeah, that's because of me'. I asked him what he meant, and he explained that he didn't like how revealing my clothing used to be, so he would overly compliment me whenever I wore something more conservative such clothing I wore for work, when going to interviews or visiting older family members. He also said that whenever he bought me clothes as gifts, he would buy items that were more traditionally feminine, muted and modest. I asked him why, and he said, and I quote 'its like that Pavlov thing. If I make you feel good about being modest, you'll do it more and it won't be like I forced you'. That's what has me confused because technically he's right, I wasn't forced to change my style. He found it really funny, and he said that my fashion sense now was objectively better than it used to be, so I should be happy. He apologised, but he was laughing when he did so he wasn't serious.  I really don't know what to make of this because it's made me not trust my own thoughts anymore. Like yeah I wasn't forced, but he admitted to using some psychological trick used on dogs to get me to do what he wanted. I'm happier with my fashion sense now because I do think it's better, but is that because he made me think that or is it actually better? I don't know anymore.  Outside of this, he's the perfect partner and the best dad to our daughter. He was the only person that supported me taking a risk and dropping out of a  university course that made me miserable, and now I'm training to join a career that I know I'll love. I don't know if I'm reading too much into this situation or that this is something that needs to be dealt with.   I would love some advice and/or some opinions on my situation because I'm honestly so confused right now.",1

I met her at a Birthday party. Luscious long hair, beautiful smile, glowing skin and lighting quick wit. She wore beautiful earrings, and a rich green shirt. I followed her around the most of the night like a puppy, trying to make her smile. Two days later, she found my account in a tagged post on our friend's instagram post and we hit it off, instantly with our texts. She had a statistics exam and I shared my flashcards with her, and silly puppy meme that said  you got this  pasted on a google doc.  Months went by and we grew closer together. She lives a bit away from me, so we'd talk on the phone, and sleep together on call. She was never ready for a relationship, and we established our boundaries real quick. But funnily enough even with all our talks about not being ready for anything more, we'd quickly start telling each other how much we loved one another, and the company we have. I'd make notes about her on my notepad, and know what her favorite flowers were (which i sent her in a bouquet for her birthday). In my most difficult times, she was my hope and my anchor. I was determined to be better because I took responsibility of who she associated with, which was me.  Somethings happened along the way. Maybe it got too much for her to handle, Maybe I made some mistakes and pushed our established boundaries. We called it quits with the love part of it and a long drawn conversations spanning over a week which ended with her wanting to focus on her self. Now, you might expect me to grow bitter about a suspended failure. But my love has grown even stronger for her. We have sort of called it quits with the situationship. But with each passing day, i find myself finding a new born respect for her. I trust that she does want to focus on herself, she's been going through alot too. And i too have moved on. I think. But i feel lucky to have experienced this love. Knowing i'd be this devoted to a feeling, the most primal human feeling, a defining feature of our collective consciousness. To have selflessly devoted myself, and truly made the efforts to understand a human being apart from myself.  It feels unlikely that i'd resume this connection with her. And I don't think I will ever complain about it. But i treasure this transient experience with her. To me, she truly is perfection, a whole being and a beacon of consciousness that lights up everything she touches. She's wise, bright, and full of life.  We're still friends, and i have an unanswered text of hers on my instagram inbox haunting me. I think I will distance myself. It'd be unfair for both of us but i thinks its a better alternative to being overly optimistic about our boundaries, knowing the way i feel for her. I wrote her four letters, hoping my the string of my words of subtle love illustrate the way i see her, trust who she is, and hopefully love herself the way i do to her. She appreciated each of those letters, and shared how she needed to hear those words.  I still am sometimes thinking about the things i'd do for her. How willing i am to buy her the entirety of north pole to have the northern lights for herself. Or how i'd buy the biggest of forests, and let her have a one-on-one time with the nature she adores so much. But now, some nights i lay in my bed alone. I know it had ended when i stopped hugging my pillows at night. Now i just lay on my back, feeling vastitude of the emptiness of my universe without her. I am working on myself, improving myself with therapy, and focusing on my own personal life.  If a higher power does exist, you can expect me to threaten and demand that it makes the universe treat her right. An egotistical outlook, i know. But she deserves the world, and all the goodness that this universe has to offer.  I still consider myself lucky. And to you who's reading this today, i hope you feel this way for somebody once in your lifetime. It's a spiritual experience where you learn about selflessness, commitment, and exercise your curiosity to learn every bit about the other person. Wanting to learn how they see the world, explore them to the fullest, and take the responsibility of easing the burden of existence by your actions and ever-presence. I really wish that you do.

It's just me and her and the cook in the back. We have had the best conversations and we are both decently flirtatious. I've never felt this way with anyone before that's why I'm so worked up about it . I know work relationships are a big no no and if it doesn't work it would be awkward since it's just the two of us. asked our mutual friend and the coworker who takes my shift to help (24 F and married). She told me she will ask her if she is ready for a relationship in general and will refrain from putting my name out to her. She told me today that she (girl I like) isn't seeing anyone and isn't ready for a relationship. I know if a girl tells you that it's another way of rejecting you but since she doesn't know it was towards me should I still ask her? I quite my job in 2 weeks so if I do say anything it will be before I leave. What would you do or say? Thanks for any help!

And have never had second thoughts on it until recently.  To put everything into perspective, me and my girlfriend have / had been together for 7 months. In those 7 months, I have never had any regrets being in a relationship with her and I felt like she truly was the one. However, until last week, she broke up with me. This breakup lasted for exactly a week until we got back together but now I have second thoughts on being back with her. The day we broke up I said to her that we should take some time apart being single and experience it then potentially get back together. But that entire week of ‘experience’ I was obviously hurt and did not get over her enough to be ‘single’. The day we got back together we was obviously both very happy but now - 5 days or so being back together, I am regretting our decision.   Ever since the beginning of our relationship, I had always told her I would get back with her once after a breakup depending on the circumstance. And I feel like as much as I do want to be with her, it is unfair to break up with her so soon after getting back together and I believe my past words of getting back together once would completely blow anything we have in the future after I have experienced being single. I feel like this whole relationship is an example of ‘right person, wrong time’.

I feel that I'm such a person. I am a guy in my mid-thirties. I have never been in a love relationship before.  I have been crying often for the past few months due to loneliness. It seems to be quite painful to be alone as your age catches by. It makes you doubt yourself whether you will ever find a lover partner in your life.  Tears always well up in my eyes whenever I see couples holding hands in public or when looking at photos of couples in social media. It reminds me of the fact that I'm still single and do not have a love partner. A part of me still yearns for such a love companionship. And I start crying again.  I couldn't help feeling jealous whenever I see couples in a love relationship. Some people have scolded me that I should be happy for other couples and not feel jealous. But when I keep seeing other people enter into relationships, I couldn't help wondering when will be the time that I will get to experience that happiness for myself?  I am looking for a lover to able to share my life with. I wish I have someone near me. A love partner whom I can sleep with and wake up to in bed and cherish having that person as my love partner every morning. And the absence of that love partner is causing me a lot of hurt and pain.  Sometimes I feel I'm not fated to live like other couples in this world. I just have a fear that I am destined to be single forever in my life.

ThrowRAjesuis,My girlfriend (30F) had a glow up while I (28M) gained 40 lbs. Having a hard time with all the attention she’s getting from guys while constantly hearing about how I got fat. How do I deal with this?,1508,14a1rgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14a1rgu/my_girlfriend_30f_had_a_glow_up_while_i_28m/,723,2023-06-15 12:57:02,relationship_advice,"When I met my girlfriend a year and a half ago, she described herself as being the ugliest she has been in her life. She suffered from depression and low self esteem after a bad break up so she didn’t care about her appearance, and she gained a lot of weight from antidepressants. I was still attracted to her because of her kindness and honesty, and I genuinely found her cute.   I’ve always been told that I’m an attractive guy, and back then I was in great shape from working out regularly. But in the months that followed, my day job became hectic and I had to take over the family business and navigate through all kinds of drama after a relative embezzled a large sum of money. I constantly feel tired, binge on food and have no motivation to work out. I mostly spend my limited free time with my girlfriend because being around her is one of the few things that make me feel better, and I want to make sure we don’t drift apart due to me not having time for her. She is appreciative of my efforts and always cooks my favorite foods for me, it is one of her love languages.   I’m 6 ft and used to weight 190 lbs, now I’m at 230. My girlfriend on the other hand has recovered from depression and returned to her confident and cheerful self. She hates working out and never goes to the gym but still lost 20 lbs after getting off antidepressants. People constantly tell her that she is glowing and looks beautiful, both in person and on social media. Some of her exes and flings have reached out and random guys try to slide into her DM’s all the time.   She has never given me a reason to doubt her because she always lets me know when she gets DM’s from guys, most of who she just ignores. She always credits me for her glow up, telling people that it’s because she’s in a great relationship that doesn’t stress her out. She also never comments negatively about my weight gain except to remind me to make sure my medical test results come back normal. She even says she likes me better now with my dad bod and I believe that because our sex life is amazing and I can feel how attracted and dedicated she is to me.   I’m happy about our relationship and happy for her that she feels beautiful again and it shows. But sometimes it just sucks seeing her get attention from other guys while all I hear for myself are “You got fat” or “What happened to you”. The worst was probably when I overheard a colleague say that my girlfriend is a knock out and I’m batting out of my league. Working out two or three hours a day like I did before is still not an option due to my tight schedule. I cannot give up my day job and no one else can handle the family business which is the main source of income for many of my immediate relatives.  I feel guilty for even feeling this way because I know I'm in a great relationship with an amazing girl. What can I do to deal with this better?",1

I wanted to be worthy, valued, loved, cherished, desired. Lusted after, even.  Years flew like leaves in the autumn. I’m now only twenty-four, and the last leaf I’m willing to hold onto has swept over my head behind me. I have no intention or strength left in what’s left of my heart to look back. I know I’ll see nothing there. The same outcome as before, and every attempt since. Logically, it’s reasonable to ascertain that I’m far too young to give up so easily on something so necessary for human enrichment and lifelong survival. Questioning it from a more emotional perspective has unearthed a new truth for me to accept- that I am holding to past hopes, and they have kept me standing in the same place I have been frozen in for over half my life. No wonder I’ve felt such disorientation and confusion. Everything and everyone around me were the moving constants. The only constant about me is my stagnancy and procrastination. And if seeing is believing, then you were never real, love. You were just a lie that fed others whilst destroying and manipulating my truth.   Daydreaming doesn’t feel so good any-more. Even if I have yet to experience that first “I like you”, the uncertainty in the slow, lingering pause before a first kiss, the holding throughout the night, the lovemaking and animalistic fucking that lovers do. All the intricate crossroads that undermine the trajectory of growing close, growing together, hitting an impasse, watching the boundaries multiply before falling out of sync and losing one another permanently, are roads that I have never known the direction or location to walk through. I have a new path now- it’s prosperity.  To escape this self-imposed prison, it’s now achingly transparent where I stand- at a point where I make myself the only person who matters to me so I can use this revelation as fuel for that long-awaited growth I have been so overdue and late to experiencing. I must leave these unachieved desires behind. Taking them with me will only slow me down and add to my weight. I lost the time for teenage love. I was never fluent in university romance either. Those birds have flown, never to be seen again. I regret not having wings then, but at least now I still have feet. They’ll support me and carry me to new heights. Climbing them will be challenging at first. They haven’t abandoned me yet despite everything, so why should I abandon myself?   I need to crystallise this and make it aware, known and firmly obvious to myself. I can’t awaken the past to compensate for my dormant present. This is not a future worth dying for. And when I do, it will only be after I have lived a life with minimal regrets. No man can ever age without any regrets. That’s another delusion I’m leaving behind. I’m leaving you behind too, love. I’m embracing what’s necessary. So I move on, knowing what’s in store. I don’t still know how to achieve it, but I finally have the daringness to take a step forward, without any strings or cords tying me back and preventing my flight. And for the first true time, I am ready. I let you go, love. I have myself to conquer, and the world too.",1

More examples: she would swoop in and offer to help that one day of the month when I would refuse to help because I'm being verbally abused unnecessarily while helping. The rest of the month she  had shit to do  and wouldn't even clean her side of the room when we were younger for example. She got rewarded with shopping trips every time she stood by mom in hurting one of us. She would end up getting most if not all the shopping trips while we got none.  She is now reaching out pretending to be in the same boat as me and wanting me to have her back while she struggles with mom.

In addition to our standards of cleanliness being different and some possible incompatibilities, I think this relationship is just taking too much out of me for this time in my life.  At this point I’m afraid I might be making a mistake, but many times I’m just so tired of being with him. My partner (26m) and I (26f) have been dating for about 3 years. This is the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in, and there’s so much love and care between us. The thing is, I just can’t imagine a future with him, and I’m wondering if the things holding me back are… valid enough I guess?  I’m open to marriage in general at some point in my life… and he knows this. But for some reason, when I imagine a future with him I just feel miserable about it. He is so incredibly messy, and never learned to clean. We don’t live together anymore because of finances, but when we did it was awful. I eventually gave up on cleaning. I would go to work for 8 hours after cleaning, and come home to the house a wreck. I’ve never lived in filth like that before, it started to take a toll on my mental health. Even when he cleaned, he did a terrible job. I have since talked to him about going on youtube to learn how to clean, and he said he would. I don’t know if he has.   Another thing is I’m certain I don’t want children, but he says he is still on the fence. When I told him I had realized I don’t want kids (I was on the fence too when we met), he asked if I would be opposed to him donating sperm in the future… so I think he actually does want kids, whether he raises them or not. I get concerned he’s lying to himself, and will say he doesn’t want kids to stay together when he actually does want them deep-down. If he does want them, I don’t want to waste our time anymore, when he could be meeting someone else who also wants kids, and I could be focusing on other areas of my life than a committed relationship.  Another issue I’m having is that he’s quite clingy. I already spend more time than I have with him, but it’s never enough. I want to spend time with him too, but I have things to get done. I have an elderly family member and my dogs to take care of (as well as myself), and he just doesn’t have that much responsibility other than school. We’re both full-time students. I care very much about my grades because I’m trying to get into a selective Ph.D program next year, yet he always asks me to hangout and watch movies when I’ve already told him I need to study. When I do refuse, he gets all sad and quiet, and I end up feeling guilty. I know he does this on purpose, guilt-tripping is his go-to move.  We will both be graduating university next year, and future planning has caused some problems. He isn’t sure what he wants to do. He bounces back and forth between working in the industry his degree will be in, or going on to law school. Like I said, I’ll be pursuing a Ph.D program.   The thing is, though there aren’t many universities in the U.S that have the specialty I want, so I will definitely have to move out of sate, maybe very far. This fact causes him to spiral on a regular basis.   He’s extremely anxious to move to another state, especially since the cost of living is higher pretty much everywhere else in the country. But he also doesn’t want to do long-distance, which I would be fine with… I just want him and I both to pursue the career paths best for us. But he keeps pressuring me to go to graduate school in-state, even though no schools here can train me in what I want to do. I noticed since I told him about moving, he has started calling me more and more often while I’m at school, upset about something random (think traffic-jam-level stuff) which I then spend half an hour talking him down. I know this may sound crazy, but I’m beginning to think he’s trying to sabotage me? Maybe even subconsciously?  Anyways, my head is too immersed in the fog to get a good read on the relationship, so I ask you, internet strangers, for your opinion. Do you think I’d be justified in breaking up with him? Is there something about my role in all this that I’m not seeing? Any comments would be helpful, thank you.",1

I’m absolutely crazy about him and he’s always telling me how much he loves me and is excited to start a life with me — we’re even moving in together in a few months. For the most part, I’m very happy with my relationship, but I cannot shake the fear that, given the chance, if his ex came back into his life he would leave me in an instant. Or even beyond that, a part of me is incredibly afraid that he’s only with me because I’m a decent looking girl that is clearly very in love with him, and he’s settling.   I have absolutely no logic behind this and I know that. My boyfriend has literally been nothing but a good and loving partner, and I have been given no reason to believe otherwise. We don’t even really fight — but the issue is that when we DO fight, it’s rarely  about problems he or I might have. Instead it’s almost always tied back the things his ex had said or done. For context, she was his only other long term relationship and it didn’t end well. I don’t really want to elaborate for privacy’s sake, but just know the relationship ended up leaving him with a fair deal of insecurity.    When this happens, I try really hard to be patient and understanding because it’s clear he has a ton of trauma from the relationship — but it’s beginning to feel like she’s always going to be a part of our relationship. I remind him when this happens that I am not the same person as his ex and that the things she did are things I’d never do. And he always ends saying he knows this and promises to do better, and he has been — but it’s still left me really insecure.  Because on the one hand, I know the relationship ended badly and is likely one he wouldn’t want to go back to. But on the other, I can see how fondly he looks back at memories with her involved. She is so entangled with so many of the good memories from his early adulthood that I know there’s a part of him will always associate her with this feeling of carefree joy, and I can’t help but be jealous.   I feel like even if I am the most perfect partner, I’m never going to live up to the girl that hurt him and that terrifies me. I know I can never control how he feels or what he’s dealt with — so how do I get over this?   TL;DR: my partner has previous relationship trauma and I’m worried I’ll never get out of his ex’s shadow.",1

She's busier than I am, so she usually works late at night while I inevitably fall asleep on the phone. She always says that she feels calmer and safer with me on the phone and that she loves hearing me breathe as I sleep. I woke up today to a text from her saying that I woke up in the middle of the night to tell her I love her then fell back asleep immediately and she loved it. Even though I can't see her in person, ending my day with her is so special to me. Just wanted to gush about it! :)",1

I know this sounds toxic but listen: at the start of our relationship (4 years ago) he was VERY sexual. Since i am too i didnt mind. It was when it slowly started to decline that i did start to mind. The sex got less and less, only one thing stayed which were the bjs. Whenever i actually wanted sex and/or get off too he declined or redacted himself. I could get him off and ask him if he could do the same for me he was like  oh uhm idk . What also doesnt help is that he kept flirting online and rping sex with his friends online behind my back. When i found out and said that i wasnt okay with this he didnt stop and tried to keep pushing boundaries saying that it wasnt real and that he was only attracted to the friends online characters.  My sexuality stayed the same and now i feel like my feels arent being met and that it wasnt fair that he was only interested in bjs.  I am not sure what to do since he also stopped cuddling and is generally not very affectionate anymore. He also often gets amgry at me out of nowhere. Is our relationship falling apart or should i still try to save it?  I cant and dont want to force him to have sex so i dont push him but i cant force myself to not want to have sex.  An open/nonmonogamous relationship wont work.  I do love him and he says he loves me and i dont want our relationship to end but i am unhappy.  Is there something i/he can try/do?   Tldr: boyfriend says hes asexual but wants BJs and kept flirting with friends online",1

We get along so easily, he is attentive to my needs, a warm and welcoming person for the most part, and has integrated me into his life, introducing me to family and friends. His lease will expire next February and he brought up searching  for a new place together. We have started looking at apartments, but I feel increasingly insecure in the relationship and am looking for advice on how to move forward.  The first time I shared my feelings for him, I told him I was falling in love after four months of dating. Admittedly, that was quite early on and it was understandable that he didn't reciprocate at the time, but he literally only said 'that's nice' in response. We had a bit of an emotional discussion afterwards where I told him this made me feel rather unsure of his feelings, but he reassured me we were fine and it didn't weigh too heavily on my mind afterwards.  Fast forward another six months, we had a lovely weekend together and I casually told him I loved him. No big moment or anything, but we had been drinking a bit and the only thing he said in response was that he would like to hear me say that when I'm sober. It didn't come up the next day, but two weeks or so later, we were lying in bed and talking about the move that may be ahead, and I was honest with him and told him I felt a bit insecure to share my feelings with him at this stage because he hadn't reciprocated, and that this makes me nervous about our move. He told me it made him sad that I was so focused on words rather than action, that he had serious feelings for me, that he  really liked  me. I have to admit, this made me so sad to hear. I asked if he could tell me the reason why he wouldn't say he loves me, but he said he couldn't.  So here we are. Of course he shouldn't say it just because he feels forced,  so I feel like I shouldn't bring it up again, but at the same time, it feels absolutely insane to me to move in together with your partner when they can't tell you they love you. Is that valid - is it a bad sign for our future, or a sign of a lack of emotional connection? Should I give him more time and proceed with our plans for now? I don't know if I'm being overly anxious or if this is as bad as it feels. Any advice or experience is much appreciated.   TLDR: Boyfriend of ten months wants to start looking for a shared apartment, but can't tell me he loves me. I'm wondering if it makes sense to continue with our plans.",1

After we broke up, she went to her guy friend which was someone I’ve been suspicious of since the beginning, and texted him pictures of me and called me weird, a crybaby, and a b*itch.   Fast forward a week, my girlfriend and I start talking again and one of our boundaries is emotional cheating and how we shouldn’t go talk to other guys about our relationship problems. I had asked her if she talked to anyone during our break which originally was supposed to be a break up (we’ve broken up in the past but it just turned into a break).  She claimed no and she was reassuring me no for weeks and would even send me screenshots. It wasn’t until I saw her phone where I saw these texts. I’m torn but she claims we were broken up. Although that may true, the way she treated and talked about me after our break up says a lot.   She also lied all week when we were seeing each other and broke trust and hid texts, so I’m telling her that what she did was emotional cheating. Also, when we got back together, she told me that in her head, we never broke up and she only thought me and would never cross a boundary. I’m torn because she went to great lengths to hide these texts from me and send so many notes about she did nothing, plus she didn’t just talk about relationship issues, but completely degraded me. I think I lost all trust. Is the relationship over?  TLDR: girlfriend called me horrible names to another guy but claims she still loves me.",1

I love being with him. I feel completely myself with him and not self conscious at all, and I could tell him anything. But I want us to stop talking, bcI want to get over him. As for why I don't want to go for it:  - I just found out , from a mutual friend, about a side of him that shocked me and made me realize he sometimes pretends to be one way to hide his true self. So I don't know him like I thought I did.   - We're not really compatible. Not as partners. We think very differently about a couple major things. - he used to be a major player when we were younger and it'd be hard for me to trust that he wasn't cheating - I know in my head that in the long run it's not a good idea. But If we keep things the way they are ...I will for sure end up hooking up with him or at least trying to and I don't want that added complication.  I've tried just being distant but then he calls or I miss him and I call.   I've come close several times to telling him I'm in love with him , too. His best friend Ray and I are close too and Ray's said  he's not the one for you, but also don't be dramatic about cutting off all contact.   I don't want to hurt his feelings. He has low self esteem. So if I say  I need space because I like you  , I know he'll assume it's because I don't think he's good enough for me.   Do I just keep being friends and don't say anything because I've decided firmly that a romantic relationship is a non starter?  Or just explicitly say I'm staying away so he knows why I'm pulling away?  Tl;dr known him since 19. I love being with him but I don't want a relationship. I just need space to get over him but I don't know how to get that without telling him explicitly. Should I?",1

Would appreciate your insights on this.   I met a guy and known him for 5 years. Then he proposed us to be in a FWB situation since he isn't ready to commit. We haven't been physically intimate yet but we act as if we are in a relationship basically doing everything couples do in relationships but so far without the physical intimacy ( so far no kissing anything and we never said I love you; we just goood friends )    I'm very confused as to whether he loves me or not.   When I am sick he makes sure I'm okay and goes extra mile checking on me every hour, he insists we say goodmorning and goodnight everyday, we talk everyday and he tells me all the details of his day, and he is very honest about things ( well even the fact that he doesnt feel like commiting) , he acts like my bf, would send me cute photos that I like, would wish me HB at midnight, would include me in all decisions in his life; whether it is what vitamin he should take or big professional decisions as to whether he should go in a business or not.  He actively listens to me, values my advice, my insights and holds my opinion on things at the top. He integrates me in every part of his life, make me meet his family, always never hesitate to help me, texts me instantly and fast always, always make time everyday to take to me before bed, whenever I need moral support he would leave all his work to come support me. He has reassured me telling me that he cares for me, wants me as his friend for life, that he appreciate me as a person and is lucky to have me around in his life. He told me that we are a team, we have such great emotional bonding, he likes that I care for him and that I understand him like no one before. He has given me many business deals, offered advise and said that I will never lose with him and he will always help and support me. Whenever he gets angry in fights( yeah we fight like couples where he gets jealous ) he usually listens to me afterwards and has actively work on bettering himself.   Well but when we talked about sex, it's where things gets confusing; he one day would talk about making love then the other says that we would just be fucking for fun, and no strings attached and that he just wanna have a good time and doesn't wanna commit.   So I'm confused. I mean is it possible that he loves me but he wants something casual with me? But then sometimes the way he talks about sex seems more like a casual physical thing only. I'm very confused.   I love this guy and it would mean if he loves me tooo but I don't know. Should I take his words at face value that he doesnt want a relationship and just casual fun sex or believe his caring actions?

I tend to fall in love quickly. I do differentiate between being  in love  with someone and  to love  someone, the latter I don't know if it's time to think about that. The first is already a source of problems...      So our relationship didn't have any major problems until now, no fights, no big disagreements. One thing though, is that my girlfriend sometimes goes through ups and downs, long periods spanning months, and she had been feeling down for about 3-4 months when we had this conversation. This conversation happened two weeks ago and we talked a bit more deeply than usual, and she said she felt like we don't communicate much or enough and I felt that way as well. I felt it had a lot to do with her mood since February where unfortunately she's been having less motivation, less desire, less energy, less sunshine in general. And I felt it to some degree, but since she keeps that inside most of the time, I didn't necessarily notice too much.      Anyway, then during the conversation, she tells me that she doesn't know / isn't sure if she is in love (with me). From her own words, she never has been in love or never felt that she was in love in the past, and so it hit me quite a bit. She said though that she does have feelings and feels attached to me, but what good is it if she isn't in love with me? I feel like with her  down mood  she has been reevaluating a lot of stuff, and isn't sure either about her future etc. so it definitely plays a role. But it hit me, and I don't know what to do or think. I asked her to check in the coming times her feelings, and how she truly feels, that maybe it's a fear or something, and that she can come back later and give me an answer. The thing is, after two weeks, she doesn't see more clearly, and I'm afraid I won't ever get a clear answer. I'm starting to think about the worst, I'm kind of  checking out  mentally to avoid the pain, in anticipation in case she says  No, I am in fact not in love . I've been on restraint mode for two weeks, and it doesn't feel good, because I cannot feel free to give her all the love I have, knowing it may not be reciprocated. I ask myself  Can I be with someone who isn't EVEN in love with me? , and I think the answer is no.      So, the main question is: What should I do? Should I engage in another conversation about all this to get an answer, risking to put more pressure on her? Should I wait and be patient, despite me (seemingly) walking more and more away from the relationship? What if she never knows the answer?      I appreciate any answer. Feel free to ask questions.      TLDR; Girlfriend said she doesn't know / isn't sure if she's in love with me, and I don't know if I should wait patiently for her answer or  force  a new conversation about this now.",1

I've been best friends with this high school classmate for 5 years (which is how long the school lasts where i live). we instantly clicked, I've never been this close to a friend ever in my life, she's the most caring, funny, unjudgemental person I've ever met and i never felt this confortable with a person ever in my life.   I've always kind of knew she liked girls and not only boys, and she came out when we were 15. I've realised i might like girls too (including boys) when i was 16, but I've always found it hard to accept it (and i still do). she's the only person that knows this.  we always joked about being so close and so connected that we should be in a relationship, and i truly always believe we are soulmates but i thought in a platonic way. we occasionally flirt for fun, but like straight girls do (i think?) so i have never seen the harm in it. anyways, i realised i might have had a little crush for her when i was 16, so i started dating a boy to make it go away. she despised him, but it made sense cause he was indeed an asshole so it totally could have heen just friendly protection.   in all this time, she always told me she would be with me, that I'm her type and she gives me many compliments, but she doesn't do this just to me so, even tho i appreciate it, i never thought she was serious. i mean, i know she really would try to do things with me, but i am not the kind of person who does stuff just for fun, i never believed she would actually be in a relationship with me and i could never handle a breakup with her. she never dated anyone, because she has some problems with physical touch and expressing emotions, she says she doesn't like relationship stuff and everyone immediately gives her the ick (that's another reason why i never took her seriously).   that changed when a friend of ours introduced her to this boy who's extremely handsome, intelligent and pretty much has everything you could ask for. they went out for a while and they even kissed once. that  threw me off unexpectedly. i guess i never have seen anyone as a threat, and I've never realised how much i liked her until now. she went out on many dates with different people, but she never liked anyone for more than a week except this guy.  I've never thought of making a move (I'm extremely insecure in these things), I've always thought i could live forever just being bestfriends because she has made me the happiest I've ever been even with just this. but now I can't stand it: i wanna be with her, I can't think of someone else touching her, I couldn't stand her talking about him and saying stuff like  my boyfriend , or her not jokingly referring to me as her girlfriend.  I don't wanna ruin this for her, he's a great guy and for the first time she's comfortable.  some days ago she told me she would leave him for me as a joke, but I don't understand what a joke is at this point. I don't know if I'll ever have the courage of making a move. I've never have been with a girl. i seriously don't know what to do because I can't stop thinking about her. i love her, i want her to be happy even if she's happy with him, even if im miserable, but I don't know how long i can take it. I don't find it right to make her decide between him or me, especially because i have dated a boy in the past and she still stood next to me so I'd feel guilty about not letting her have the same freedom.  her and the boy are only going out for now, it's nothing official btw  should i live miserably for as long as he's around, open up about my feelings, or distance myself from her?  TL;DR: I'm in love with my best friend of five years but she's dating a 10/10 boy she seems to really like at the moment, and I don't know how to act",1

But we were not well matched and fought constantly. She gave up on the relationship and withdrew and kind of ignored me for about 8 years. After counselling, I gave up, I fell out of love and told her and now she wants to save the relationship and is treating me like I had always wanted. But I think it's really too late, I don’t believe in romantic love anymore, she thinks I am “not trying”. I am just happy to be room mates and cloister away for the last 20 year of my life,  – is this realistic, is it just a cop out on my part, should I just make a clean break?  So long story, I fell in love with this woman in my mid-thirties, she is one year younger than me. I have just turned fifty eight). Smartest person I ever met (has a PhD in biological sciences), I am a dentist, she probably has double my IQ. I worshiped her from the moment I met her. She was pretty, sure, but to me she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen, week by week, month by month she became more beautiful to me.  We are great at intellectual conversations but we also clashed frequently. To be fair, I have a very arrogant self-assured demeanour and what I thought was playful debate was often experienced as a crushing attack for her. Little things, big things, she often felt I was attacking her in the way I would ask a question or would feel like a genuine question was intended to belittle her views. Sure we all miscommunicate  with our partners but so many times I was asking a question because I knew her judgement would be better than mine and out of left field she would feel there was some other agenda. Our therapist explained that she had some kind of self-hatred that I could trigger with out knowing and I should not take her, sometimes very emotional, responses personally. But she would get very personal in verbal attacks and ridicule me as if to prod me to get angry. If I managed not to get angry, which really was 90% of the time, that enraged her. Basically every argument led to her feeling “like a worthless piece of shit”, if I was right then that made her feel even worse.  Maybe two nights a week she would leave our bed and cry herself to sleep in the spare room, for years. Not always without reason, I worked long hours and she did most of the housework. I was very black and white, she was more nuanced. We have been in and out of counseling for years mostly focused on how to argue fairly – short term impacts. Neither of us were ever unfaithful.  So after years of this she withdrew, completely. Very little physical intimacy, a tired sounding response when I would ask a question. She didn’t touch me in any way, except for  charity sex  on birthdays or other occasions. I missed being touched so much. Her responses to me became shorter and more off hand. She seemed to have no interest in talking to me. If I talked I would often get a bored stare as if she couldn’t wait till I was done talking.  At around the 12 year mark of our marriage, during an argument, she point blank said “You should stop talking to me like I have any investment in this relationship, I don’t and I don’t understand what you are still doing here.” It wasn’t said in extreme anger, it was more said in despair. It very was hard to hear. She said it again some years later, a little more pointedly, beginning with – “as I told you before..” That hit really hard, meant it wasn’t a passing thing. I think she only stayed because she was too depressed to leave.  So about 3 years ago,I went to counseling again, basically telling the counselor I was on the edge of giving up too unless I could find a breakthrough. The counselor didn’t intend it, but the outcome of the counselling was that my idealized vision of the relationship popped, recognised that it had not been great and was unlikely to improve.. Over a couple of months I realized that I was deifying this wonderful woman but there was really no great relationship there, we were never well matched.  Suddenly, I fell out of love. It was a truly horrific experience. I decided I had to tell her, figuring that would be the end of the relationship, a relief for her. I told her and she was, surprisingly, devastated. Suddenly she wanted to work on our relationship. She became attentive, wanting to be physically intimate, never seeing any veiled attacks in my conversation any more. Listening to my stories and laughing hilariously instead of sending me a bored stare. Now she says she really loves me. But I wonder if she is just scared of being alone.  When we had troubles, I had always told her I would stay, no matter what. I realize now that was a recipe for failure. If only I had known all those years ago that if I had drawn a line in the sand, communicated that I would leave if I was not happy, that perhaps the relationship might have been more equal .So that conversation was 3 year ago, we haven’t had sex for over 3  years now. I had to tell her I just don’t feel that way about her anymore, She is devastated but tries to initiate sex again every 6 months or so.  She occasionally asks me “to make up my mind “or she would ask“is this going to change”, she is hoping something might reignite old feelings. It eats away at me that she now does so much for me spontaneously and I do so little, emotionally, for her. We chat amicably over dinner, that’s about it.  I do feel some anger that now she is nothing but pleasantness, why did we suffer through all those years if, seemingly at the flip of a switch, I am actually bearable to be around?  So we are both nearing 60 and I probably need to “make a decision” rather than just co-exist. Why haven’t I left? We have a nice house and are comfortable. I guess I am scared to be alone too. You wonder what old age will be like alone. I would lose the (handful) of couple friends that we have. Our adult  son and daughter are closer to her than me (I am admittedly a bit of a jerk at times, maybe only average EQ) and I would probably not see them as much. Financially, I could retire much  earlier if we didn’t split up. I have basically told her I am happy to co-habit, to support each other where we can, to be friends, but I don’t see my feelings changing. I don't look forward to holidays with her, but I don't hate the idea. She would like at least some shows of affection, but that is hard when your heart is not in it.What would I do if I left? Do I want to go through the painful ups and downs of a new relationship – I don’t feel strongly attracted to the idea.  I am a member of a spiritual group that would probably advise me to just stay and spend my time in retreat most of the year – which is what I really want to do when I retire, but that’s not a relationship is it.  Sorry for the long blurb, but I guess if you got here you were offered the TL;DR. Happy to receive your advice, is it unrealistic to just be room-mates, am I torturing her, should I just make a clean break?",1

I just gotta say something, I found love for the first time and I am amazed at how much better everything is ever since.   We’ve known eachother for 4 years, been close friends and held eachother very dear. But only recently were we both single and things started to develop between us.   I’ve never had mutual feelings with anyone before, it feels almost surreal, I thought this would never happen. I was so disappointed in people, life, everything. When we started dating, I was at a point where I thought I’m better off being single, I don’t need someone else, people are just going to disappoint all the time. I was coming out of a bad relationship and was just tired of men being jerks to me my entire life. I’m also coming out of terrible trauma involving men.   Yet there he was, right under my nose, in all his awesomeness, for all this time. I’ve always admired him deeply, and appreciated him as a person. He is just an amazing guy and I always pictured us being close friends forever, I always thought I wouldn’t give him away for anything. I always felt like I would do anything for him. Yet it never occurred to me that it might be the formula for love. I’ve had unsuccessful crushes before, the butterflies were there everytime, but not with him. With him it always felt safe. No matter what the trouble was, if he was there, I knew it would be fine. For 4 years I felt all these things towards him, and now that we are together, I feel like I have been gifted the world by being with him. I feel like I can do anything, like he is everything I ever wanted. I wouldn’t trade him for anything, not even for my life. That’s how I’ve always felt, and how he feels as well.  Love heals. Having fought severe trauma and depression since I was basically a toddler, he brings into my life so many things that I’ve never had. Unconditional love, affection, respect, emotional validation, peace of mind. Life truly does take a different turn when not everything you see is through a dark filter. I’m not afraid of heartbreak anymore. I’m not afraid of being hurt. I feel safe. I feel at home.   Thanks for reading. ❤️",1

Backstory: I’ve (20F) been in a relationship with my boyfriend (19M), let’s call him Chris, for 2.5 years. We met at fast food place we worked right after I finally gotten rid of my ex(20M), let’s call him Alex.  Alex and I dated on again off again for the year of junior year and for a few months back in freshman year of high school. It was a very toxic relationship. With Chris, it’s been the most healthy relationship I could’ve ever dreamed for.  I took Chris’ virginity as he is not experienced at all. The sex was not the best after we got into the swing of things and now we’re in a routine. We always talk about trying things but never actually do.  I still O from sex with my bf and never think of my ex during, just thought I should add that sex with my ex was toxic, Iykyk.  Sometimes my dreams are filled with my ex, not sex ever really but it’s just my brain romanticizing the toxicity we had. We used to sneak out and do whatever we wanted.  With Chris, he comes from a good yet sheltered family and even after 2.5 years it’s been hard to adjust. Me thinking about my ex has been on again off again for a year now and while I have NEVER acted on these dreams/thoughts I can’t help but wonder what would happen if me and my ex ran into each other (we go to the same college).  I’m not saying I fantasizing about being with/sexual relations with Alex, I just don’t know how to get him out of my head. I’ve told my boyfriend about the dreams but I never tell him that it’s me romanticizing anything.  What do I do? I’m racked with guilt and I feel like I’m suffocating.  TLDR; I catch myself romanticizing my toxic past with my ex but I’ve never acted on it, should I tell my boyfriend? Perfect song to capture my situation: the way I loved you by Taylor Swift.",1

Hi,  This is a throwaway. We've been together for 2 months. I'm on the fence about breaking up because I don't know if it's a me problem or if it's a him problem. The problem is he is logically thinking and I'm emotionally thinking. He's highly opinionated and often shares that strong opinion. For example, he says consoling is bs and trans people are disillusional (these beliefs that are important to me). Besides that, he is sweet, funny and good-natured. He also has a good job, a flat and wants me to have a family long term.  He brings a lot to the table. However, I feel my values and emotions are unimportant and invalidated. We got in arguement last night. He went on a walk with me to make me happier and told me I think about emotions too much, yet It's difficult with my mental health challenges. I don't think he understands what I go through, although he tries to be supportive. I do my best to bring things to the table like cooking, cleaning, work hard on my own ambitions, emotional support and physical intamacy. I try really hard, but I feel alone at times.  If I broke up, I don't know if I'd be throwing away a good future away. I'm scared of being too old to have a family and being undesirable. Am I being a ungrateful or am I being gaslighted?  TL;DR My boyfriend invalidates my feelings. He has one fatal flaw. Do I stay or stick it out? I'm inexperienced.  Edit : Thank you for everyone's input. I felt confused, but I feel I made the right choice now.",1

For most of the last 3 years our relationship had been long distance (5 hour drive apart) due to work obligations, but we kept regular contact and saw each other at least twice a month.   This period was obviously deeply stressful on our relationship, and clearly more so for him than me as he was the one living away from all his friends and family.  In late 2021, he confessed to me that he had cheated on me. This confession really strained our relationship, I thought about ending it, but I loved him too much and still wanted to rebuild our future together, so we worked to repair and rebuild trust.  We had rebuilt trust very successfully, and I took him overseas to meet my extended family (I'm a first generation immigrant). It became obvious in the latter part of 2022 that in 2023 our job circumstances would allow us to move to the same city.  I was so ready to move forward and start our lives together that I proposed to him, he excitingly accepted. The next day however, he broke down in tears and confessed he couldn't marry me because he'd been a terrible partner to me.  Initially I thought he was referring to the incident of cheating he'd admitted to and I tried to reassure him that I had forgiven him and he needed to learn to forgive himself. But he then admitted he had cheated more than once, it had been a repeat thing with different people on multiple occasions while we'd been living so far apart.  I was of course upset by this admission, but relieved he finally shared the truth with me. He did assure me that he had not cheated on me subsequent to his initial confession in late 2021, and in his eyes he was trying to avoid hurting me further after seeing how upset I was after his first confession. Ultimately he realised this was wrong and I deserved to know the full truth.  We temporarily separated for a few weeks til I figured out what I wanted to do going forward and we were only in intermittent contact. I realised during that time how much I missed him, and that I did still love him despite the hurt he had caused me. I also do believe he is genuinely sorry for the hurt he has caused me, and so I decided to try and slowly rebuild the relationship.  We are now living in the same city and no longer doing long distance which has been wonderful for our relationship. 99% of the time I am incredibly happy, he is loving, kind, thoughtful and has worked so hard to regain my trust.   But every now and again when I remember what happened I am overcome with a sense of tremendous sadness. I struggle to imagine getting back to a space where I feel comfortable imagining proposing to him or something like that again.  I don't know what to do. I feel we are the perfect match in more or less every way, I have never felt so in love with another person. But I just don't know how to overcome this obstacle. I can't imagine breaking up with him, but I also don't know how to work past the depressive episodes I get when I recall the past.  Beyond just trying to talk through our feelings, are there any practical steps I should be taking to try and chart a course forward?  TLDR: Bf cheated on me, I still love him, don't know what to do.",1

He seemed very lost so I suggest a couple of things but it just seemed like he didn't wanna do it . Like I can feel like the effort wasn't put in so much ,  and I remember our first anniversary , I made him like a cute sunflower keyring but he didn't really get me anything that day .

Is making and gifting an inherently girl thing or am I expecting too much ? Should this be considered a red flag??? Should I talk to him about this??

So I went and since the first time we saw each other we have a spark, it was notticeable. As I said before I had a lot of job to do so I went multiple times, I loved to be with him but I first I thought it was because he was gentle and it was all the transference phenomena but the days were passing and he was being more and more lovely and I started to notice certain things like he didn't want me to pay (of course I did it, I hate not to pay), if I was in pain he would touch my cheek, we started talking about our lifes and we found out we had a lot in common, yada, yada, yada. But I was in a relationship so I didn't do anything.      The years went by and I kept going, the spark never dissapeared but like I said I was in a relationship, then the lockdown came, in the middle of the lockdown I fell and broke a molar, I called him and went, due all the covid situation he was alone without a secretary and almost no patients so the times I went we were alone, he used to put my favorite radio and listen music together, we spent time together with the excuse of the treatment but I noticed he tried to extend the treatment, sometimes I thought it was all in my imagination but it seemed real. We had a real conversation where we talked about our problems, I told him about my relationship and my problems with eating disorders, he helped me A LOT with that, but nothing more happened. I noticed I fell in love with him and I thought the best was to take distance because that was making me sad.     A year went by and I thought I forgot him. I cut my relationship (my ex was a violent person and a lot of therapy was needed to make this decision) and I came to the conclusion that I wasn´t in love with X, that I had a horrible relationship and I thought the thing between X and I was love but it was only a good dr-patient relationship and I was trying to fill the emptyness I was feeling. I was postponing the six month checkup at the dentist so I went, well... I saw his face and my heart went to a downhole, I wanted to hug him like I hugged him the years before but I noticed he was being cold and it was completely reasonable because we didn´t see each other for a year. He started to do the checkup being distant to me, not a talk, not a question for 10 minutes but then the magic came again, we started talking and laughing and I didn´t know what to do with all the feelings coming down to surface, when I had to say goodbye I said  well I´ll see you in six months  and he said  six months? that´s a lot of time  and like a stupid I said  Yeah, well I´ll see you  and I left.      And now I´m spiralling. I don´t know if I should come back and telling him the truth, or not come back NEVER. I don´t know if I´m crazy and he is just a lovely person with everyone and I´m just a crazy woman.

I mean via maybe saying something that hurt your feelings or betraying your trust?  And how does the relationship live through this?  Is it possible for someone to keep letting you down for you to just keep forgiving forever?  Or is your relationship just seriously that perfect that you met someone who never let's you down?   My own parents have a 40 Yr old marriage. They may seem loving in strangers eyes and are quite sticky to each other, however, my dad has constant infidelities and lots of fights and my mom crying over it through my growing up years. So I don't know how my mom keeps forgiving and can still feel happy. For context, financially she makes more so she never needed him for financial reasons. She makes such good money that she was able to pay for full time nannies so she can concentrate on her career. My dad is not a hands on person and believe children are solely a woman's job.   I personally leave a relationship the moment I felt let down. As I didn't want to tolerate what my mom put up with for life.  So I am curious what kind of relationships other people have that can last 20 to 40 years?  For context, maybe it's true love for my mom because she takes care of my dad through bankruptcy, sickness, and all his infidelities and never stopped loving him and doing so much for him like would personally get up early to bake his favourite cake before work etc. I felt my dad gives very little in return and infact always criticise her, even when she cooks for him, he criticises her food etc.  So I mean, is this what true love looks like? I can never be like my mom to love this much.",1

I’ll try to not make this post really long, but I need to get an outside perspective.   I am in the professional services business and recently the client that I tend to welcomed another professional in the team. At first I just noticed how cute he was, but he seemed to have a relationship (I saw a ring on his finger, where I live it indicates he might be engaged) but stayed professional and we had only professional interactions so far (he began about two months ago).  As time went on, we had more interactions and we always got along, another important piece of information is that we work from home, but call it whatever - he recently moved to my city (which is not that popular).  A couples weeks ago we were on the phone about work, and as conversations go we were talking about cool places in the city and what would be a good thing to do, next thing I know he was asking me to the movies. Against my better judgement, I went. It was the first time we saw each other in person and it was great - butterflies, he was cute, sweet and we had a great time. This first night we talked a lot and I asked if he had a girlfriend - he said he was engaged, but when he moved to my town he broke up the engagement because she didn’t wanna come with him.   A couple days passed, and we were seeing each other a lot, but now, my worst fear is real. Since I knew he was engaged just a couple of months ago I knew it was a risk, but I wasn’t planning on it becoming anything, even though we’re great together.   Recently he went to a diving trip with his friends, and it was the first time we didn’t see one another for a couple of days after we met. When he came back we talked and he said his ex was on the trip (according to him this was scheduled way before they broke up) and obviously to nobody’s surprise, she wants to get back together and is willing to try and move out here. They were together for 2 years and apparently liked each other a lot. I asked if they had any flashbacks and he said they didn’t, which was somewhat of an indicator to him and his dilema now - he said he needs to decide what he’s going to do. He’s a very logical person, but says that making decisions impacting other people is really hard for him.   Honestly I just feel like I suck each and every-time I try to get close to someone. So now, he can choose to somewhat continue what we have (whatever it is), get back with his ex or be single and mingle.   I didn’t ask for it, but he said he has enjoyed getting to know me, and finds meeting me fate or coincidence, because he didn’t expect this connection at all.   I just want to know if anybody has experienced something like this or if anybody knows what I should do - like run for the hills.  If you got this far, thank you for reading. Any words of wisdom are appreciated.",1

Tldr: Boyfriend(33m) hasn't said I love you after living together for six months and dating for 1.5 years. Every other aspect of relationship is near perfect.   It feels weird writing here but I don't feel like I can talk to my friends about this. My boyfriend (33M) and I (29F) have been together for about 1.5 years, lived together for about 6 months (we're in Europe). It has been amazing.   We have both been through ups and downs in our own individuel lives in a very short time (death of a family member, involuntary sick leaves, graduation from uni, getting fired, getting a new job, a cancer scare - yep it's been a lot).   Through all that we never argued, we supported each other. When one is down the other takes over and vice versa. We help the other out when they are busy or stressed. Our relationship is very equal in all aspects.   He is an amazing man. He call me beautiful, sexy, lovely, he cleans, cooks, asks me about my day, challenges me when necessary. If I want to go on a walk, we're gonna go on a walk. If I wanna watch a movie, we're watching a movie. And vice versa. It's the best relationship ever. Still no fights (only arguments because we are very different when it comes to some topics and we like challenging each other). We laugh so much. We have fun with everything. We are currently looking at buying a house together. Marriage and kids has been discussed very loosely.   Now, what is the issue then?   Well as my title says - he still hasn't said I love you. I've  tried  saying it and all I got back was  I like you too . Auch..   My question is... What do I do? I feel like he should know after 1.5 years and I know I could just ask him. But I'm scared he'll tell me, that he doesn't feel that way about me and I will have to end the relationship. I truly love this man. He is one of the best things to happen to me and I don't want to let go of that.   Is it possible to love someone and not being able to verbally convey it? Or am I just fooling myself here? ",1

We became quick friends and lovers. We were so much alike, but different too; perfect complements of each other. As a schizoaffective and autistic person, that's effing rare! I thought I found the one, but then yesterday she told me she can't do this relationship anymore; her life is too complicated right now and can't give me what I need. So it goes.  I won't lie, I cried. But, I didn't suffer. How is that? Well, in short, I'm a monk and I have a healthy relationship with love itself. I love unconditionally and without attachments. That means that I accept the people I love as they are, and that they are free to be their own person. I don't own the people I love, so loving someone does not change by having them or not. Love may be a feeling, but it is also a verb. To love, you must want someone to live their best life, with or without you. True love is selfless.  I woke up this morning with more energy than I normally have. I feel reborn. Truly, if I had the choice, I would have remained with this woman, but I don't, so instead of resisting it, I accept it, and my attachments to her are released and I don't suffer as a result. Thus, to love properly, you have a duty to escape the rule of your desires. Let go, and drop the hot coal when you feel it burning you.  You do this through spiritual work. You need to feed yourself novel experiences and tame your  self  in order to liberate yourself from the karmic fetters that bind you to being any one way and suffering because the world requires you to be something different. Upon doing so, you will begin to adapt your  self  to the world, and then you are like water; able to conform to any vessel you're placed in. And when you are able to do this, you can love someone to the best of your ability and not suffer at the loss of love.   I say all this because I used to be a slobbering mess when it came to love. I felt unloved all the time, and those times I had love, losing it was always wrenching. I've come a long way on my journey, and I can say from experience that this is a better way to be. Love is the most important thing in the universe; learn to love right to be the most you can be.",1

So I am (23M) currently in a relationship with [23F] and we both love each other a lot. To the point where we can comfortably share most things and we can express what we like and dislike easily with each other.   My current problem lies with the fact that since falling in love with her I get aroused without issue but getting an orgasm is basically impossible. Eg i would be aroused, she would start giving a blowjob, it would actually feel good but after a while my penis just becomes flacid. Same thing happens during normal sex... As an extra note I would add that my overal sex drive feels 'overshadowed'' by my feelings of love. It's like my head is so full of thinking about her that there's very little space for my sex drive. The most that seems to happen is being aroused.  As a background, before falling in love I've never had a problem masturbating about once a day or at least once every 2-3 days before my sex drive becomes too high. However, the day i started feeling in love that sex drive just completely went away.   As a man, this seems to be a very unusual thing and finding any information has proven very hard. Also, so far I realised it might be a focus issue but even when 'living in the moment' I somehow lose that sex drive. I hope anyone has any ideas on how I can become more sexually active? Any advice, stories are more than welcome   Thanks!",1

Me and my ex worked together, side by side, for a year, and we live together for two years. We talked about marriage, planned it, and were going to be engaged last year, before i finally made the difficult decision to end it. It was within my thoughts for several years (on off), because we had several unresolved problems that always made us ended up fighting the same thing over and over again; yet neither party was going to change.  Within a short period of time, my current bf and i got together. The thing is, due to the short break between relationships, during the start of my relationship, i was still struggling with my process of moving on from my ex. I was going to end things with my current bf because I don't want him to be someone's rebound, he's too nice for that. I ended up telling him how i feel; and he's incredibly understanding. He told me how perfectly normal it is for me to still thinking and missing my ex, since it is not easy to just move on from someone who was a big part of your life; he told me to just take it easy, and as long as i have feelings for him (which i am) and not using him in any way, then everything is okay, he also told me to always tell him whenever i feel lonely or when i miss my ex, and he'll find time as soon as he can to accompany me.   I can't put into words how sweet he is, but i feel like TA for having a new bf while still missing my ex, not only that, i sometimes still feel guilty about breaking things up for many reasons, and i still worry about my ex, and sometimes i still question if my decision to end things was correct or not. But, whenever i am thinking about getting back together with my ex, i don't want to leave my current bf. I feel like i am the cruelest girl who play with both men's hearts, which they definitely don't deserve.  However, truth be told, i do love my current bf. Most of the things that i complained before during my relationship with my ex, it is now resolved with my current one. There are of course some issues with my current one as no one is perfect, but so far it is far less draining and a lot more support. I always feel undeservedly lucky to have found someone so nice so fast, while i'm being a girl who can't even move on from her ex.",1

I have a loving, supportive family back in my home province but I chose to stay with my man to try and create a life so we could have our own family.  They lost their father when my young brother-in-law was 12 and their father asked that I take care of the two youngest in their family as best I could before he passed, so I did my best. I have helped out my B-I-L as much as I can being the mom figure to a teen along with also being a mother to my own daughter in the process with no prior experience with teens besides being one myself at one point.

I seriously do not get myself into their family drama but my partner does not stick up for me during these conversations. At this point I don't know if I should speak my mind as a graduation for the second youngest happened this weekend and my partner insisted I go (eventhough I stated I wanted to stay home multiple times) and I was not mentioned as a sister-in-law or my daughter as a niece, which made my daughter hurt as she's close with the grad.    All of this said, my partner and I booked a hotel for the weekend while we were down for my S-I-L's grad and there was a wedding going on and the bride looked STUNNING. Absolutely gorgeous.

He's supposed to visit this summer but my husband (30sM) is understandably opposed.",834,13r0ja5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13r0ja5/my_30sf_nephew_9f_has_started_acting_out_and/,124,2023-05-24 22:50:56,relationships,"I’m going to preface this with a request for kindness, as I’m genuinely really upset and struggling with this right now. And please don't use this story on tiktok or podcasts or whatever. I'm terrified it'll get back to my family. I just desperately need your help, reddit.   I (30sF) am the aunt of two **awesome** kiddos (9M and 11F). For many years, I was practically just down the street from their home, and they spent a LOT of time with me. Their parents were young, and I was a little older/more mature with more financial resources. As a result, I took on sort of a hybrid role in their lives, where I wasn’t quite a parent but I also wasn’t just an aunt.  I guess you could say I was an “Aunt Plus”?  A few years ago, I moved out of state for work, but am still within a few hours drive of them. We no longer get spontaneous hangouts, but I’m able to travel to them for their big moments at school, birthdays, ball games, etc. **I genuinely cannot overstate how much I love these kids.**  We have been planning for them to come visit for a few weeks this summer, where they’ll attend a local camp during the day and then stay with me & my husband (30sM) at night. The kids and I are very excited about it (and my husband is just happy I’m happy, lol).  But.  The younger of the two kids has had behavioral issues for years, which his parents have done very little to get him professional help for. Several years ago, he was diagnosed with auditory processing disorder and there is a chance he has (undiagnosed) ADHD, as it runs in our family (I have been diagnosed myself since my early 20s). Doctors told nephew’s parents he needed to start seeing a therapist to develop coping skills and recommended that the two of them see a parenting coach that specializes in families with behavioral issues.  **They never took him to see a therapist. Not one single time.**  Fast forward five years, and his behavioral issues have gotten worse. It kills me, because he is genuinely the SWEETEST kid, when he isn’t overwhelmed and acting out. He wears his heart on his sleeve and is so, SO eager to make others happy. When you compliment him on doing a good job (doesn’t matter what) his entire BEING lights up. I know I’m biased, but he genuinely is an incredible kid.  However, like I said, the behavioral issues are a lot worse….and, recently, they’ve turned to stealing. He stole a package off of a neighbor’s porch after school one day, only to open the box and throw the entire thing in the ditch. He was made to apologize and return/replace the item.   When his father called to ask me for advice on how to handle it, I \*once again\* brought up the need for therapy. I even offered to handle all of the work: I’d call around and find a good pediatric psychiatrist, I’d schedule the appointment, and I’d even take a day off work to drive 3+ hours to take him myself if need be! All they needed to do was grant me the necessary permissions to do so and send me their insurance.  They did not.  My husband was (understandably) wary of still having him come stay this summer, but we made a game plan re: lockable door knobs for his hobby room and not leaving the kids unsupervised. In the end, he agreed to still have them visit.  Yesterday, I found out he was caught stealing again. Only this time, it was cash, from his grandmother’s garage sale. He didn’t steal the money for himself – in fact, he got caught because he took the money to school to give to his friend (a kid with significantly worse behavioral issues, who the teacher had warned nephew’s parents about when she first noticed them hanging out this year).  Nephew’s parents, once again, doled out punishments, and this time they are pretty severe (at least in my opinion). He’s grounded for the ENTIRE summer and was pulled out of baseball, which was previously the only club/social activity they had him enrolled in. They said he’s still allowed to come to my house, however. And, of course, they are uninterested in considering that maybe, just maybe, this could be the result of them STILL not getting him therapy.  **Reddit, this kid is CRYING OUT for help.** I’ve tried explaining that kids act out when they’re not getting their emotional needs met. I’ve tried offering to do all the scheduling, pay for all of the appointments, anything they need to get him help. It’s never made a difference. And (before anyone suggests it), I can already say, for absolute certain, that CPS will not intervene as this does not rise to the level of intervention in my state.  Now, I don’t know what to do. I know I have to tell my husband about the newest stealing incident, and I know it’s likely to be the thing that makes my husband back out of us hosting them. And I know that’s 100% reasonable on his part. Hell, if I were in his shoes, I’d probably do the same.  But I also know that my nephew **DESPERATELY** needs someone to step up and be there for him, especially this summer. I know he’s hurting, and already starting to internalize the narrative that he’s a “bad kid”, even though he doesn’t understand WHY he acts out or how to stop. I know that his parents aren’t going to fix it, and there’s no other aunts/uncles who could/would. I am the ONLY option.   What do I do? How do I help my nephew without hurting my husband? Or vice versa? Even more importantly, how do I get my nephew the help that his parents have failed to get him?  **TL;DR: Nephew has started acting out and stealing, not sure how to handle his summer visit without hurting him or my partner.**",1

Be brutal and honest I really need it rn.   Backstory: I left a 7year relationship in December 2022 with a guy (my BD we are early 20s) More like he left the country and broke up with me while there. Relationship was toxic (cheating since early days on his part, got verbally and physically abusive last 2 years of relationship) but even so I had tried to get him back for the sake of our child together(2yrs old) and because I genuinely was attached. He refused and told me he was dating so I accepted and grieved the relationship.   I met a guy (call him T) in Feb 2023. 2yrs older than me. Originally we were just FB and we both made it clear we didn’t want anything else. In April we started seeing each other every 2nd day (more like nights cause I have my child full time as dads overseas) and have since. It has been communicated that we both have feelings for each other at this point and it’s no longer just for the s3x. He treats me so good even though we aren’t offical.  He calls me pretty honestly like every 15 minutes when he’s with me and just truly respects me as a mother and a individual. However we are still just FB, we haven’t had a date or hung out outside of night hours besides movies and seshing at mine (he’s stayed the night a few times but left by 10am)  Okay so here’s my situation girls😭😭😭 BD has come over for our child’s birthday and stayed for 2 weeks. The second day he was he here he came over to see our child, once child had seen him - it was impossible for him or I to leave. Kinda like our toddler was enjoying mum and dad together again after 7months. Stupidly I let him stay at my house for his entire stay due to this…  As BD’s do he tried to sleep with me once it got to night and uhhhh my high sex drive caved 😅 it got complicated from there. BD expresses he has seen T pop up on my phone consistently since he’s been over and he’s wanting to get back together and work on our family. Idk what he expected but I told him that I have feelings for T and that I only moved on because I genuinely thought he was done with us. But I asked him to sit down and have a proper conversation regarding what went wrong and how to fix it if we were to try again - because we have NEVER been able to communicate anything he tends to just brush it under the rug. Typically he gave me an ultimatum- end things with T and then he will have the conversation with me but until then it’s too hard for him too.  Ahhh okay so this is not like me. But I lied to BD and said I had cut him off in order to have the conversation because I genuinely feel like if he had grown and changed I would try. But the conversation never came. 🚩However because of that lie I somehow ended up back with BD? Like he thinks that was me agreeing to a relationship again with him.  He just started acting all coupley and idk in the moment I missed him too and was acting the part too. But it feels fake and forced idk I genuinely can not for the life of me set boundaries 😭 like idk how at this point I’ve gone along with it for too long.   Okay so with T. I haven’t told him that I’m in a situationship with my BD again but he knows that he was staying at mine for the 2 weeks etc. I try be pretty open but that’s just weighing on me hard cause I don’t want T to stop talking to me. As selfish as that is😭😭 He’s asked me out to a dinner date tonight for the first time ever and even offered to include my child if I wanted - so I can tell he’s trying to take the next step and 😭😭😭I don’t wanna f@ck it up man I really don’t   So yeah girls I’m in a f@cked up situation 🤦🏽‍♀️ I don’t even know what advice I’m looking for, I just genuinely have no one in my life I can go to for anything😂 If my thoughts help - I kinda feel like my BD is only trying again with me because he seen me moving on and that it’s not going to be long before he’s cheating again and verbally abusing me and name calling me. I know people can change but something in my gut is telling me that I should take this chance with him to finally cheat back after all the time he did, and then when he cheats again to leave.. is it fucked up? I feel like I’ve become him.. but I really don’t want this situation to hurt or effect T in anyway. When I say I want to be with this man I mean it 😭 it’s only be 4 months of seeing him unofficially so I also feel delulu for that too. Anything and everything please 🙏 all advice and harsh responses welcomed",1

It’s been nearly 4 years of marriage but I’m unhappy I used to blame my in-laws for our differences because they have a big negative influence on him and after a couple months of marriage they grew to dislike me because I didn’t want to be the obedient daughter in law and live with them anymore. We have lived alone for about 2 years however things haven’t been that much better. Our issues consist of him wanting to spend more time with his family than with our daughter and I.   My husband also doesn’t give me much of his time, attention or make any effort to plan things unless i suggest them. I feel as if I’m just the classic housewife but nothing more I’ve communicated my wants and needs multiple times and he tells me he will try to change and I’ve seen changes but it never lasts. He changes for a period of time then goes back to how he was, we constantly argue and we are generally not happy with each other even on special occasions such as birthdays.   I’m currently at my family’s home and I’ve said I’m tired of being disappointed every time by him and want a divorce. However to be completely honest I’m scared, I know that I’m not happy with him but I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to regret it.   No one is perfect and I wouldn’t know what deal breakers are as I’ve only been in a relationship with him.  I was considering of living together for my daughters sake ( because even if she sees him in the day when I put her to sleep at night and it’s just her and I, she cries for him and it breaks my heart).   Im so confused because his a good person provides for our family and a good dad however not a good husband because I feel he doesn’t love me or care for me even though he says that’s not true. I have another concern he doesn’t know how to express him self or communicate his feelings when I question him about it he’s not sure why.    I thought about the possibility of him actually have difficulties with understanding emotions (I don’t know if this is important but he has a family member that has low level of autism) because when we argue he says it’s not an argument and in general he doesn’t communicate much and doesn’t know how to start a conversation it will take maybe 20 minutes or I have to start it. He’s socially awkward and doesn’t know how to deal with certain situations and even says hurtful things then says I didn’t mean them or I don’t know why I said that after I explain why I’m hurt.   I’ve suggested marriage counselling before however he wasn’t too keen on going. He told me that he will change and won’t make me feel neglected and hurt again but he’s told me that so many times before that I just don’t believe him.  **TL;DR;**: Is feeling neglected and unloved in a marriage enough to divorce? because other than this problem my life with him is good and my daughter living a happy life in a two parent home. Is it enough that he is just a good parent but not a good husband? How do children cope with divorce? What do people do in these situations? Any advice would be appreciated Thank you.",1
nich0lascag3,I (26F) found out my friend (26F) recently told my boyfriend (27M) she’s in love with him. How do I confront her?,20,14afvs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14afvs3/i_26f_found_out_my_friend_26f_recently_told_my/,21,2023-06-15 22:44:10,relationship_advice,"My boyfriend and I started dating 10 months ago after being friends for a couple of years. We were introduced to each other by a mutual friend (let’s call her Jane). Around when I met him, Jane and my now boyfriend shared a single kiss. Jane had just gotten out of a long term relationship, and had expressed many times after that single kiss that she thought it was bad, felt wrong, and that she wasn’t attracted to him. She’s went on to date many more people since that she’s expressed to me and other friends that she had deep feelings for multiple of those individuals.  A year and a half ago I started to sense chemistry between my boyfriend and I. I immediately told Jane, and she was so excited at the idea of us dating tha days later she made plans with each of us individually, and surprised us with a group hang out. It went well, and multiple occasions after that she found ways to make sure he and I had alone time at group events.   After a few more months of flirting at group events, I ask him out on a date, and it was amazing. Three days later, I am spending the day while with her, and tell her all about it. She again expresses how excited she is for both of us, and can’t wait to see where it goes. A few weeks go by and out of no where I get a text from her saying she thinks it’s messed up that I am dating him, and she can’t get over how upset she is. I am shocked. I respond saying I don’t quite understand, and I think she should speak about it with one of our mutual friends because I couldn’t comfort her through this. From her messages and our years of friendship, I knew the only response she wanted was me diminishing the potential of this new relationship.   Over the next couple of months, I hear from multiple mutual friends that’s she’s speaking poorly of me and my relationship. I let it slide because I want her to just work through things. When she eventually confronted my boyfriend about it, he makes it clear that he’s happy in our relationship, and things quite down for a few months.   Now 10 months later it’s picked back up and she texts my boyfriend saying that she in love with him, and can’t stop crying over the fact that he’s dating me. He has done a good job at shutting it down, but I’m at my breaking point. She and I have been friends for years, and if she can’t stop interfering in my relationship anymore, I don’t want her in my life. My preference for this conversation would be having it mediated by a couple mutual friends we both trust and respect because  I don’t believe there would be any accountability otherwise. Any advice?",1
ReactionClear4923,Love is a funny and mysterious thing. How lucky are we to get to feel it,87,13e8yny,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/13e8yny/love_is_a_funny_and_mysterious_thing_how_lucky/,9,2023-05-11 01:07:15,love,"I truly believe love is a force we still do not fully comprehend.  My wife and I met near the beginning of the pandemic, a couple of months into the lockdowns (Canada).  *For a bit of background: I had gotten out of a 9 year relationship almost a year prior, where I was manipulated, gaslit, emotionally cheated on, and felt lower than I thought I ever could. After 9 months, I was on my way up from rock bottom (new job, new city, no more drinking, new everything).*  So anyways, there I was 9 months into the dating scene and ready to call it quits. I was having no luck in connecting with women I met, and trying to hold a conversation over dating apps was like pulling teeth. Finally I decided  maybe dating isn't for me, and I need to be single for a while , and with that decided to delete Tinder. Right then, I opened the app and saw my wife's profile.  My heart skipped a beat. I'm not just saying that, I don't know if it's possible, but my heart felt like it literally skipped a beat. She was (and is) the most beautiful person I'd ever seen, I could not believe my eyes. But it wasn't just a physical attraction, it was much deeper. Everything around me went quiet, I felt the air leave my lungs and every fiber of my being felt like it was jumping and screaming for joy. It's weird, but it felt as if we had known each other in a different life and had finally found one another again. Without a doubt I know I met my soulmate. I had never felt anything remotely close to this before.  I swiped right and a few minutes later, got a notification saying we matched. I was elated. We started chatting and hit it off right away. The conversations we had flowed naturally, like we were old friends and we just clicked on every single level. When we finally met up for the first time (3 weeks after chatting) I was so nervous that I talked for a solid 45 minutes about god knows what before she even got a word in. I was hooked from the beginning.  One month into dating we said I love you and 3 months after that we moved in together. Everything in my life has improved 10 fold since my wife came into my life. I had very little money and was in massive debt when we met due to poor decisions and a divorce a year prior. When I told her about my finances, part of me expected her to run the other way. Instead, she got us some beers and sushi and offered to show me how she budgeted, and helped me make a plan to get out of a debt and utilize my money more. Within 6 months I was fully out of debt and am now financially thriving, thanks to her support.  The ideas I had of relationships went right out the window when we started dating. I had been so conditioned by my prior relationship that everytime even the smallest thing went wrong, I expected her to blow up and blame me. When she she said everything was fine, I would be on edge for days waiting for her to pick a fight, but the fight would never come. I went to visit my friend in a neighbouring city for the weekend a month into us living together, and even though she had suggested it (since it had been a while since we got to hangout together), I was nervous the entire time. I kept checking my phone and waited for passive aggressive texts and when those didn't come I expected to walk into a fight about how selfish and awful I was for leaving. Instead she hugged me, kissed me and asked me how the weekend was and if I had fun, and was ready to hear all about it. At that moment, I realized that  the other shoe was never going to drop  so to speak, and that this is what a good relationship is supposed to feel like. Just love, trust and open communication.  She's the most caring, smart, beautiful, ambitious, principled, generous, kind (and a million more) human I know. Every single day I wake up and am beyond grateful I have the privilege of spending the rest of my life with this most amazing woman. She makes me want to be better. Not just for her, but for myself too. She sees things in me that I've never seen myself, or would have never considered were there, and I'm finally starting to see them to. I feel like I can accomplish literally anything I put my mind to, so long as I have her by my side.  When I'm with her, all the small problems of my day become insignificant, and I feel like I'm walking in a dream where nothing can hurt me. Without trying she melts my heart. I'll walk into the kitchen while she's doing dishes, and it's like I'm seeing her for the first time all over again. Somehow she thinks, sweatpants and an old shirt will make her less attractive, but no matter what she wears or how she thinks she looks, she is the most beautifully stunning person on the planet to me. My heart feels like it will burst with joy and love every day now. There are no bad days anymore, only good ones with some inconvenient and sad moments, but I wouldn't trade a single one of them in for anything.  To anyone who doubts if they are worth love, you are and you will find it. The moment I had decided that love wasn't for me, I met my soulmate, and my life changed forever, in all the best ways. Love is funny.",1

Sometimes I still can't believe that she's actually my girlfriend, that such an amazing person loves me like I love her. She's genuinely the sweetest, kindest, funniest, and smartest person I know. She's perfect in every way, from the way she smiles to the way she'll hum whenever we go on walks together.   She makes me happy in ways I never thought possible, and just being next to her while we do nothing seems like the best thing in the universe. We've fallen into the habit of calling each other at night and sleeping while we're on the call, which I love because I can hear her breathing as she sleeps.   Both of our love languages include a lot of physical affection, so I always cuddle her as she falls asleep on me when we watch a movie. The more time I spend with her, the deeper I fall in love with her. I'm just so happy and feeling so lucky that I get to have these moments with her. Thanks for listening to my gushy rant :)",1

When we first met, we dated in person for 8 months, and then for the next 9 months we dated semi-long distance (5 hour drive) due my roommate not wanting to renew our lease. I ended up moving back home for those 9 months and finished my bachelors degree. Upon completing my degree, my partner begged me to come move in with them and their parents, as the long distance was starting to take its toll on them. So I agreed to move in with them and have been living here since.   However, I’ve come to realize that Jane and I have very different priorities and outlooks on the future when it comes to finances. Since we’ve met, Jane has not held a stable job due to anxiety and “hating the system, corporate rat race, and capitalism.” They have very little income from a few DJ gigs they do, totaling to a little over $200 a week. Their career goal is to make music and art, which I 100% support, but I think having a stable job in the meantime is important. Jane also spends pretty much all of their income each week, and doesn’t see the point in saving for the future.   In contrast, I am a rather frugal person,and saving for the future is very important to me. I work full time in entry-level finance (the pay isn’t that great sadly), and am aiming for an analyst position in my current company within the next six months. I would have no issues being the breadwinner, but I would like Jane to have some stable income to contribute a little bit towards expenses.   Jane and I would like to have our own place a year from now, but I don’t know how we would be able to afford rent without Jane having any reliable income. I’ve tried speaking with them about it several times, but they never want to have that conversation. They also refuse to work retail due to anxiety, and are limited in other job options as they cannot drive. As much as I love them, I’m starting to worry about our future financially. Any advice on how I may be able to communicate the importance of healthy finances to Jane despite them not wanting to talk finances at all?",1

We broke up after the first three but got back together after he realized he is ready to put me as a priority in his life and maintain a stable relationship. He basically finally decided he wanted to make things serious between us.   We both have been single for a long time before we met one another and, oddly enough, we’re both each others first relationship after a break from relationships for around two years. After all of the abuse and hurt I’ve endured from, not just relationships, but people as well, he’s the first person I’ve ever met that’s actually helped teach me how to start learning how to love myself. He’s teaching me that I can trust people again. He’s great. I can go on and on about him really. He’s humble, ambitious, kind, smart. All of the good things. When I think of him all I think about is light and positivity. I know no one’s perfect, but, he’s perfect for me. Everyone has some ugly sides to them (I know I have a few as well) but I can even find beauty within the few ugly bits about him. It’s been around 3 more months and some change after we got back together and I’m realizing that I’ve fallen in love.  This past month and a half I’m realizing I’m catching myself right before I say “I love you” on accident. A few weeks ago I actually accidentally said those words, to which he didn’t say it back. I later apologized for saying I love you being that it was on accident since we never really deeply communicated how he felt or where his heart is at and I didn’t want him to feel I was jumping the gun. All he said, however, was that it was ok and not to worry about it. So I left it at that and never approached the subject further afterwards.  I can’t help my feelings. Idk how to explain it but the best way I can describe it is that the passion I feel for him is burning inside and I can’t hold it back anymore. I do love this person and I know it for a fact. But I’m not sure if he feels the same way or if I’ll scare him away in telling him how I feel. We’ve talked about a possible future and how he’s flying me over with him to his hometown for the holidays to meet his family. But he’s very reserved and closed off as a person in general. So I can’t ever tell how he’s really feeling. And when we have conversations and I tell him so, he feels a little bad that I’m not able to tell what he’s actually feeling. We’ve talked about and established what our love languages are. However, when I’ve asked how he feels for me before he just says that he “likes me a lot” but doesn’t really express why or how he truly feels. So, I hold back my feelings because I don’t want to make him uncomfortable if he doesn’t feel the same way I do or as strong.  I understand that love doesn’t really have a time stamp but people feel things at their own pace. I don’t want to be at the finish line when my partner is still trying to get there, if that analogy makes any sense. And I know I have to communicate, our communication is very open and honest. However, telling someone you love them after being single for a while is scary. Especially when you’re not 100% sure how the other person feels about you or if they feel the same, rather. I don’t know what, when, or how to say that I love him. If anyone’s been through the same thing or understands please share your thoughts, advice, and stories. I need all the advice I can get and it would help me out tremendously. Thank you so much in advance",1

We were both coming out of relationships, and his breakup seemed like it was hitting him very hard. I had just gotten out of something with someone who was on the rebound and it was not good. So, it was easy for me to push Carter into the friend zone and keep him there. We still developed a close bond, but as friends. There must have been something there, though, because our mutual friends usually assumed we were together unless one of us, usually me, set them straight.  About a year in, one of those mutual friends made a move to pursue me. When Carter realized this, he didn't take it well and shut down. Although he didn't completely ignore me, he became distant. Weeks later, he admitted he'd put the distance between us to protect himself because he had developed feelings for me. He professed his love, but I reassured him my feelings were only platonic. After that, we tried to stay friends, but ended up going separate ways.  Skip ahead to 2022. Carter and I reconnect. Everything is still there between us, and this time we explore the physical element. Both single, we agree to take things in a non-platonic, but casual and non-exclusive, direction. It's exhilarating.  After months like this, I ask Carter if he feels everything is going as great as I think it is. He says yes, but that he has compartmentalized us and isn't wanting to get more serious or become exclusive right now. I am surprised, and it is a red flag, but given our history, it makes sense to me. He's been burned by his feelings for me before, so it seems fitting he wants to take things slow. He'd also previously mentioned he was shocked by what was happening with us. So, I just assume he needs time to adjust, and I am ok with this.  A few months pass and when we are together, it seems our bond is getting deeper and deeper. But I notice Carter isn't as engaged with texting as he once had been. We used to playfully text throughout the week. Now it's once a week, usually to confirm a time and place to get together.  At times, I send  hey how's it going?  style messages, which he promptly responds to. But he rarely asks how I am unless I ask him first.  His lack of engagement becomes more noticeable with time. Eventually, I ask if he's still interested in what we have. He says he is, and says sorry for distancing himself. He tells me he's been going through a lot and that it's  difficult to handle . (We both have been undergoing career changes, which we talk about when we are together.)  He initiates plans and we hang. We have our most  connected  experience yet and stay up all night, talking. Then, he distances himself again, for the longest time yet. 10 days go by. I send a text, checking in on him. He again apologizes for being distant. I ask if he's free, he says he's busy (which is true and confirmed by social media). A few days later, he initiates plans with me and we hang. Things are ok, but he seems very distracted.  At this point, I feel way more invested in this than Carter is. Two days later, I text him and tell him I noticed he was distracted the last time we were together. He replies with some jargon about his line of work. I respond  Wow, that does sound like a lot, good luck with everything you've got going on this week . He leaves me on read.  ....And that's where the story ends. This was over 3 weeks ago. I haven't heard from Carter. I know he's alive because he posts on social media, and he views my posts too. And, he's not always working, because his posts show him at the bar and fishing with friends.  As you can imagine, this all feels really weird. I could follow up, but after doing the heavy lifting and experiencing his slow fade for months, my pride hasn't let me.   What could be the reason for his distance this time around? I am mostly treating it as a classic case of  he's just not that into you  but with our history, I don't know if it's that simple. Since years ago he distanced himself to protect himself, I've been thinking maybe that's what he's doing now. Or maybe he played me, even though I don't know him to be a player.  Tl;dr Reconnected with a guy I had friend zoned and things turned romantic. Then he did a slow fade. He has a history of distancing himself when he is scared of his feelings. I am just left wondering what happened.",1

I didn't really know any of their family apart from a cousin and one of his friends.   I was sat with my friends from work talking and laughing until they went off and danced with their wives and talked to other people stuff like that. I'm not a dancer and I was no where near drunk enough to go and dance so I was just sat there appreciating everyone else having fun and everything that was happening. I'm quite anxious and shy so I don't like going up and speaking to new people unless they approach me first.   While I was sat there a woman, probably around 30 came up to me and grabbed my hand and asked me to dance. At first I just laughed it off but after she started pulling my arm I got up with her. We danced for a while and it was the best, most romantic and happy feeling I've felt. She asked me if I had a girlfriend, i said no (never have). And she told me her boyfriend didn't want to dance and he was stood talking to some friends.   A slow song came on and she showed me how to dance with her, twirling her around and bringing each other close. We danced cheek to cheek and embraced it.   This was without a doubt, the most romantic and heartwarming feeling I've felt. I've been on or 2 dates and slept with a couple of girls but this was something else. She was beautiful. And the way we were twirling together, bringing eachother closer, the eye contact we were holding, and the subtle moving of hands softly touching places they maybe shouldn't. It felt like something out of a film. I loved it. After the last song had finished she just said  oh you  and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I kissed her back.   I don't know if she felt sorry for me sitting on my own or what but I couldn't care.  It made me realise how little love I've ever received and how much I'm yet to experience. And after that night all i want is to have that sort of connection again. It's hard to explain how I feel. But this moments sitting with me",1

Everything started out wonderfully. We had a really great time just being together whether it was sitting on one of our back porches watching the sunset, gardening together, going on adventures, camping, hosting parties for our friends, doing all of these wonderful things together that we had both longed to do with a partner. We just got along so easily and things were peaceful between us. I fell deeply in love with him after a few months.   The sex was fun from the start, but I noticed almost immediately that he had a difficult time finishing, and would lose erections mid sex. I was always kind and sensitive and would enthusiastically try to get him back into things. But I realized he was seemed pretty down on himself when it would happen. I can understand that to the best of my ability. But because he was down about it, my efforts to help him get back into things we're usually null. He would tell me to squeeze really hard if I was playing with him and trying to get him back into it. For him I could never squeeze hard enough. It also made me feel weird, because I was afraid to hurt him. But I wasn't about to shame him for his sexual desires.  I had also noticed quickly that he enjoys drinking much more than I do. He was always having a drink every night if we were on the phone and each night if we hung out long enough and late enough, he would start pouring drinks. I didn't partake often as I prefer not to drink because I lost my dad to alcoholic cirrhosis when he was just 57 and needless to say a life with an alcoholic dad will turn you off of the stuff. Specifically he died drinking 2 gallons of whiskey a day. This is only relevant because the more time I spent with my boyfriend in person the more I noticed he drinks whiskey all the time. It's difficult for me to even be around the smell of whiskey. About 6 months in, I talked to him about this and told him I wasn't sure that I could continue the relationship because I prefer not to be around alcohol and people drinking it. I suggested that we part ways despite how much we enjoy each other's company. It was a difficult conversation, but he ended up telling me he didn't realize he'd been drinking every night until I mentioned it and he said he would cut back.   I decided to keep going with him. Around this time I started wondering if the alcohol was contributing to our intimacy problems with him going soft in the middle of things in the bedroom.    After about a year together, our sex life started to dwindle all together and I began to feel rejected and unattractive. I couldn't understand why he couldn't stay hard or finish, or sometimes even get hard with me. We had a conversation about it and that's when he told me that he *has to watch porn in order to get hard.*  He also said he watches it everyday because he works from home and *it's just so easy to browse reddit nsfw* on his other computer screen. I tried to be understanding as he said this has been an ongoing issue for him and he's afraid if he stops watching porn that he won't be able to get hard for me at all.  Over time I felt even less attractive and I asked him what kind of porn he likes and told him I was trying to figure out if I was his type, since he was able to get off with porn. My self-esteem took a hit over the last 2 years as I constantly questioned if I was doing something wrong or if he was just not attracted to me. Yet the rest of our relationship was really wonderful. We had such a good time together and had gotten to know each other's families by this time and it just felt so good. He has been loving and kind and I have been the same to him. We would support each other's hobbies and that felt amazing too to be creative with someone.   Now we're two years in. What I know now is that he drinks whiskey every single night of the week and has not kept to his own word about cutting back on drinking despite telling me several times he would, his own suggestion and choice. He still watches porn every single day and our sex life has been non-existent for 4 months. (Prior to that it was about once a month, in the beginning we had tried at least once to twice a week - always resulting in going soft, or not getting hard at all.)    Then there were two incidents recently that hurt me deeply and grossed me out. The first incident happened the night before we left for vacation. It happened to be my son's 16th birthday party and my boyfriend said he would come after a work luncheon. The work luncheon was over at 5:00 p.m. he never showed up to our party and called me around 11:00 p.m. to say he and three co-workers, one guy and two gals had stayed at the bar drinking and he just got them Ubers home. Mid call he told me one gal was calling and needed him to come rescue her. He was drunk off his ass while he was driving. I also didn't understand why he would need to go rescue them if he had called them an uber. The next day I had a lot of questions. He changed his story multiple times until finally he said he was only with one co-worker, a female and she tried to drive home but she was too drunk and pulled over so he drove to her while he was drunk and he took her home. I still think there's more to that story, but that's all I got out of him in the end. I was really upset by all this but our flight was leaving for family vacation that same day. While we were on vacation with his family, he flirted with his step-cousins 18-year-old friends in front of the entire family, and made sexual remarks about them to me directly when we were in private. He also entered their bedroom without knocking to wake them up and he stood in there for a couple minutes making jokes and whatnot while they were waking. I confronted him about both incidents and told him I didn't think it was okay to do any of that. He told me he didn't realize how it came off and that he thought he was joking and never thought to knock on their bedroom door!  Everything in our relationship has been slow and steady and peaceful, except that the drinking has made me uneasy, the porn has made me feel worthless at times and now with these latest incidents, I can't get past them. I don't feel right about the way he behaved around those gals. Let alone the incident with the coworker. On top of that we ended up having a bit of a disagreement when discussing those things and I brought up the porn and the fact that he's willing to spend his vital energy looking at strangers but he won't put any effort into our intimacy. That's when he yelled at me,  If I wanted to be an a****le, I would say at least porn is consistent!!  Implying that I'd never been consistent sexually, disregarding how enthusiastic I started out with him until I began to feel so down with rejection that I was admittedly feeling too hurt to even try. In the same conversation he also said that the only reason I feel so rejected with him is because I faced rejection in my last relationship. Which is bull because I attend weekly DBT therapy in an effort to heal unhealthy patterns within myself. I really think it was unfair of him to say that and I don't feel that my last relationship carried into this one since I go to therapy with the purpose of trying to be able to live my life without carrying burdens from the past.  Anyway I want to break up with him. He's been texting me the last 2 days as if everything is normal, I told him I did not want to go on our date 2 days ago, and that I didn't want to speak on the phone yet. Last night he sent me 20 text messages which essentially paraphrased all of my sorrows and he just added apologies on to them and said he would  cut way back on the porn.  Reading the messages actually turned my stomach and I have felt like I've been got punched ever since the vacation and the co-worker incidents. I feel like I'm going to vomit when I think of him. This is similar to when my gut instinct is telling me that I shouldn't attend an event or hang out with certain people. So I feel my body does not want to be with him anymore, and neither does my mind. My heart aches because I love him deeply and had pictured a future with him that we talked about often. It sucks because he really has been so sweet and thoughtful to me and those around him, but recent events with the other women don't sit well with me.  I told him that I needed some time to respond to his texts and I just went to bed last night. I want to break up with him but I really don't want to see him in person because I think if I get near him and we start hugging and getting nostalgic it will be harder for me to break up. That's what happened when I tried to break up with him over the drinking. I'm thinking I should break up over text or phone call. I normally think that's pretty messed up, but in this case I need to protect my energy and heart and I'm afraid I will give in to his words and his hugs.    I feel so sad and confused and I wish I had just ended things the first time I wanted to. My body told me that there was something off, but my heart got the best of me and I stuck around.  TL:DR; boyfriend of 2 years drinks every night, watches porn everyday, can't get hard or stay hard with me intimately in person, flirted with other women and disregarded their privacy, then blamed me for our lack of intimacy. How do I break up with him?",1

I know, it’s not that long. And I felt like this is a one-sided relationship. I’ve been feeling like this for 3 months now.   Whenever we go out to eat, I’m the one that pay for the bills. If we do decide to cook at home, I have to buy the ingredients and I also have to cook most of the time. She maybe cook for me like 3-4 time in total. But I don’t really mind that, as I like to cook. But the issue comes whenever I asked her to stand next to me so that if I need some assistance, she’s there to help. But she never wants to do that. She would rather play her video games on her Nintendo Switch than to help me with cooking. So I’ve decided to stop cooking for her for the past month or two now.  She’s also get grumpy very easily whenever she have a bad day. She work in customer service and I’m in sales, so we both have to deal with angry and unreasonable customer almost on a daily basis. When I have a bad day, I know not to take it personally and just let it go so I don’t lashes out to someone else. But my gf is different, she will not hesitate to lashes out her frustration on me. Sometimes, it comes in a reasonable form, like telling me everything that’s been going on in her life that day. And others, not very so healthy way. Like getting mad at me for the smallest thing, such as getting upset with me for not saying I miss you when coming back from work. When stuff like this happen when we first start dating, I’d say sorry and do whatever she want. But now, I realize it’s so emotional draining and emotionally abusive of her to do it. So I just stay silent and ignore her.   Also, I always has to be the one to ask for intimacy. When we first start dating, I don’t mind doing that. But now, I feel so unwanted romantically and physically. I’m not some fat and unattractive guy. I’m actually really fit and I go to the gym regularly. There were time when I wanted to see if she’ll initiate intimacy if I don’t asked for it. That lasted 9 days with no intimacy and I just give up and ask her for it. One good thing tho is that she has never declined my request before. But at this point, I feel like she doesn’t desire me physically, which is the only characteristic that differentiate a romantic relationship from a friendship. Usually, I would tell her how I feel and ask if she can improve. But when it comes to romantic gestures, I don’t want to force her to desire me when she doesn’t.  My belief is that if I love someone, I want to better myself for that person. And help that person whenever I can. I guess my love language is act of service. But I feel like she’s just with me for the benefit that I bring to the table and not because she love me. I wanna hear from other’s opinions first before making a decision. Can I save this relationship? Or should I just give up and go find someone better? I probably can’t find someone better in the U.S tho. This country glorify women to be selfishly thinking for themselves and traditional family role get demonized. So maybe I’ll just find love overseas",1

I fell in love very hard and get butterflies whenever I see him.      So I should be happy, but he doesn't feel the same about me. He has said that he cares about me and feels responsible for me, and that I am  attractive enough  so he will be able to have sex with me, but I know that he looks at other girls and he said I will have to accept that he will watch a lot of online content but that he will try to not do it when I see it. He has also said that he will be faithful and not cheat on me.      He is emotionally very distanced and cold to me, so I don't know where my warm feelings are coming from. He is from a good and rich family and it could have been so much worse so I think I should marry him, but I don't know what I should do with my feelings. I feel like my heart is breaking when I am around him. How do I  get over  him even though I will marry him? Maybe it would be easier if I bury my feelings and have the same attitude towards the marriage as he is? But how?      He has never been with a woman. I have had a boyfriend in secret before him but it fizzled out. So I know how good it can feel when both are in love which makes it harder to get over him now.",1

The conversation went great from the start - he’s super interesting, funny and really charming. We had a lot in common and the conversation just flowed seamlessly. He’s a psychiatrist with a lot of hobbies, a parent (I really felt understood by him because I’m a single mom) and appeared super non judgmental but a bit too enthusiastic for my liking. So we agreed on a date the next day. We went out for dinner and then drinks until like 3 am and I had so much fun with him. We shared lots of laughs and stories and jokes. However, I wasn’t really physically attracted to him. I don’t know. I just didn’t feel a spark, like his personality was great but something felt off in the attraction department.      I thought okay, maybe it’s a me problem. He brought me home and we hugged goodbye (no kissing) and he seemed super into me. He asked me to see me again as soon as possible. I agreed because I wanted to explore our connection and thought maybe the attraction would grow over time.       We then had two more dates. He was super nice in both of them: he cooked me a really fancy dinner and gave me a thoughtful gift (nothing big, just a mug with a picture of my favorite anime character). We kissed once but I didn’t feel a spark. Or anything at all. He told me it was amazing and that he felt all the butterflies and everything, just super excited about it. I internally cringed because I couldn’t reciprocate. Also I just kept feeling he was a bit too excited about me. I don’t know, we’d only seen each other 3 times.      So last night he texted me saying he really liked me. Like all of his texts, it was intense: super enthusiastic telling me about how beautiful and special I am. I decided to be honest and told him I just didn’t feel the same about him, and that I didn’t want to waste his time. He replied with a seven (7!) minute voice message telling me he is IN LOVE WITH ME. That he wants to explore a future with me. Bear in mind, this is a divorced man in his 40s.       I am actually looking for a relationship. I’d really like to fall in love and have someone be my forever person. Just have a nice life together. But still, I would never dream to tell a man I’ve only been on 3 dates with and only kissed once that I’m in love with him. My friends tell me that I’m just not used to being treated with care and respect and that’s why I’m running away from him but to me this feels a bit like love bombing. But what if I’m wrong? This guy has a great career, a very unique and charming personality and we click in many ways. Am I making a big mistake? What if attraction grows over time? I still can’t get over him saying that he’s in love with me so soon.",1

In that time, though, she had slowly asked me to give up some hobbies I really enjoyed and that were a good outlet for me. For example, I was an avid collector of Star Wars Lego sets, but she asked me to stop due to their expense. Fair enough, I drifted towards video games which I could play with friends. She was concerned I was up so late, and again, there was some expense with this, so I cancelled it all.  Finally, I got into playing D&D with friends. We originally played once a week for about 5 hours at a time. I fell in LOVE with the game, it was a great stress relief and a way for me to connect with friends I otherwise never saw. We recently had a baby, he's just under 4 months now. I took a break from playing for about 2 1/2 months and was all in on parenting. After a while, I asked if I could go back to playing every other week, and for about 2 sessions she was fine with it.  Now, she's said she thinks it takes away too much time with our new family, even if we play every other week at our own house. I also work 36-48 hours a week, 12 hour days, so I get 3-4 full days at home. She's alone with our baby when I'm at work. When I'm home, I spend as much time with her and the baby as I can. I encourage her to work out (one of her hobbies) everyday I'm home, which she usually does happily. I also try to get her to take a break from parenting and see friends, but she refuses. In the same breath she gets upset that she has no time for herself, but then also gets upset with me for asking for time alone with my child so she can relax.   I'm the only one working, and while I want to spend time with my family, I also need an outlet for my stress. I'm afraid of losing my friends by never seeing them. I've tried to explain this to her, but she gets upset and focuses on countering all my points instead of listening to me. Now I'm borderline depressed, and whenever she asks me  what's wrong  im afraid to tell her since it'll just lead to a fight.  Am I being too selfish with my time?

So I don’t know what to do about this situation. My BF (42/m) seems to be head over heels in love with his SIL (25F). She is beautiful, cultured, intelligent, talented and interested in all of the things he seems to revere and respect. I (35F) am not perfect. I’m not cultured or into the things they seem to share interests in. He will jump at his phone if she messages, he replies to her messages first before mine, he just seems infatuated. He called her fantastic. He talks about how amazing and strong she is. She’s just having his brothers baby and he is on tenterhooks about it. Fawning over her.  What do I do? I can’t ask him about this as what can I do? Do I play second fiddle forever? Is this all in my head. He’s a wonderful partner and is loving in every way, expresses desire for a future and a family. When she’s there he’s focused on her. He can’t take his eyes off her it feels like. I can’t shake this feeling that I’ll never live up to his ‘dream girl’.",1

He’s cheated on her multiple times before me, and although he claims to have her ‘permission’ this time to be sleeping with me, I’m sure he doesn’t have her consent to basically be in a relationship with me. I read some of their messages a while ago (I know…) and he lies to her all the time with such ease it makes me uncomfortable. She lives in a different country and honestly I don’t think she has any idea what a piece of shit he is. I love him and he loves me but I no longer feel comfortable dragging this out. I don’t want to hurt him by telling her everything but I feel like I should. I also want him to pick me over her in the long-run and I know that won’t happen if I ruin his relationship (and it probably won’t happen anyway right?). Do I leave and never speak to him again? Do I tell her and then block him on everything? Any advice on what to do? I’m so torn.

We have an incredibly close, deeply loving relationship, so I really want to emphasize that I'm not asking this because I don't love him or love him any less than I used to or anything of that nature. My husband is a very emotional person (and I mean that as a compliment) and tends to love who/what he loves incredibly intensely and hate that which he hates very intensely too. This is particularly true with me, as he has always been very upfront that he loves me more than anyone or anything else (and his feelings are requited).  However, I feel that his capacity to love me just seems greater than mine to love him. I don't mean this to say that I'm incapable of loving deeply - when I compare myself (a nasty habit, I know) to others I think that I generally love as intensely as or more intensely than most people I know well, but my husband far outshines anyone else I know in this regard. He is so selfless without thinking about it, clear about what he would do for me (both with words and actions), and just plain affectionate that I frankly feel bad that the degree to which he feels and does these things is not quite as natural to me.  I do adore him with all my heart, and he deserves to feel the abundance of my love for him to the same extent that I feel it from him. I want to be able to train myself, I suppose, to open my heart a little deeper and make some of the more intense expressions as automatic as they are to him. How can I do that? Is this something that I can actually work on?  TLDR: I want to be able to deepen my love and expression of my love for my husband more - how can I do that?",1

My GF F/29 and me M/24 have been together for over a year and recently she asked me who would I chose if an argument ensued me (meaning her) or my parents. I replied I would chose neither and try be peace maker as I wouldn't want either set of people I love to feel as though I don't love them. She was outraged at this and told me Im not ready for a serious relationship.  I then asked her (already knowing what she would say) who would you chose between me or the your pets? She obviously replied her pets and said she would chose them but that she loves them differently. I think this is a bullshit answer and clearly shows the double standards.  Her pets draw so much of her time and energy I have to force her to do things with me. She rarely shows affection to me on her own accord, I'm the one who always showers her in hugs and kisses and massages. She massages me as well sometimes to be fair. Even sex is just a task she has to do sometimes, our sex life is completely different now, it's always a matter of get it done then that's that. She would ignore my plans for example to take her to a market instead she would  take the dogs to the beach even though I asked her to go to this market with me a week in advance. I just feel like I'm just a convenient thing to have in her life so she can have her animals and a human connection. It hurts and is extremely frustrating. We could be having a heart to heart important conversation and she will stop listening to me to go tuck the fucking dog in bed.  I'm not asking her to not care about her pets or show them attention, all I'm asking is to remember that she has a partner and pets should not be the center of her attention.   Just wanted some advice on how to handle the situation and if I'm wrong or right in my feelings.  Edit: OK so some things I didnt actually mention and some corrections are: - the sex is fine she is into it but it's not so sporadic a fun as it used to be  - when we are out together, pretty much everytime we are out the house away from the pets, she is awesome and shows affection and is completely different compared to when she is at home.  - she refers to her pets as babies and insists of giving then human names and not  animal names .  - on birthdays and monthly anniversaries we do awesome things for each other and make each other feel special and loved.   TL:DR my girl friend says she would chose her pets over me, her love for her pets is affecting our relationship and she doesnt want to change.",1
SteefBuscemi,My boyfriend's best friend has been acting strange towards him lately and it's making me uncomfortable.,995,13vzux0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13vzux0/my_boyfriends_best_friend_has_been_acting_strange/,75,2023-05-30 19:38:14,relationships,"TL;DR my (29F) boyfriend'S (30M)  best friend(31M) has been making weird comments lately to guilt him into hanging out with him. I work with the friend so I'm not sure if I should intervene.      My (30M) bf and I (29F) have been together for 4 years. He has a friend named Dan (31M) who he's been friends with for around 10 years. Dan has a drinking problem and when I first met my boyfriend he drank often as well. Pretty much the entirety of their relationship was getting drunk together and watching sports. Half the time when we go over to Dan's he's already drunk, tries to get my bf to take shots with him, and sometimes passes out while were watching a game. My boyfriend has slowed his drinking down immensely and has become an overall healthier person, but Dan has remained the same.   Maybe some important notes: Dan is gay, but is not super open about his sexuality- my boyfriend was one of the first people he came out to. Dan has very few friends that live in the area. My boyfriend also doesn't have many friends but does have another best friend who Dan doesn't like for seemingly no reason.    About a year ago I started working for the same company as Dan. We get along fine so we never really had any issues. However, over the past few months there have been some questionable interactions between Dan and my BF.   The first was the Super Bowl. For the past few years my bf was watched the Super Bowl at Dans house, this year my bf decided to throw a party because his team was playing. He invited some friends, including the one Dan doesn't like, so when he told Dan, Dan's exact words were  end of an era.  Which made my bf feeL guilty and he almost cancelled his plans but ultimately decided to follow through with the party. Dan ignored my bf for some time after that.   Then a few months ago, Dan invited my bf on a 10 day long road trip for Dan's birthday. My boyfriend wanted me to join but Dan insisted we couldn't both have work off for that long (which is true as we're on a small team). My boyfriend tried to back out but decided to go when Dan told him he'd otherwise cancel the whole trip because that was too long to drive alone. Then on the trip, Dan guilted my bf into paying for expensive meals by bringing up the fact that he'd already spent a lot of money on hotels and gas (they drove dan's car). It's also important to note that Dan makes a lot more money than my bf and I do and he knows that.   Then a few weeks ago, Dan and I were texting about work, I could tell he'd been drinking. He brought up the fact that he doesn't have any friends and I said he had me and my bf and he responded  he's in love with you, he only 'loves' me.  He quickly tried to say that he didn't mean anything weird by that but I ignored the message.   Then a few days ago he tried to invite my bf over to watch a game and eat dinner. My bf declined because he was tired and wanted to spend time with me. Dan asked if he was declining because I work with him, and my bf said no. Dan then said it was weird that he wouldn't want to watch the game with him since they always do, and that he wouldn't be making the elaborate dinner he was planning because he didn't want to eat it alone. My bf felt guilty but irritated because he'd just been over to Dans a few days ago.   I guess I'd like advice on how to handle this. My boyfriend is pretty non confrontational, but he is a grown man who can stand up for himself. I'm just becoming more and more uncomfortable with Dan's behavior, but I also don't want to make it weird for us at work. It just feels like he maybe views my bf as his life partner..?",1

This is just mine & if you feel differently that's totally okay and doesn't make your feelings any less true. These are just my feelings & I'm curious about people's responses/feedback.   Thoughts?  The other post has me really invested in this all of a sudden (and this is more what I meant anyway).  A lot of you called me a hopeless romantic on the other post, but I think it's more of a nihilistic attitude that I have. If the relationship falls apart to me, it never really was real/authentic to begin with. I view the experience as beneficial, that I cared for them, but I wouldn't view it as love-love (if that makes sense).  I just do not view ex's as love - I view it as care. I view it as an experience. I don't think it was meaningless, I just don't see it as love. If it was love, I think it would've worked out. I could've thought I was in love - that doesn't make it any less painful when it ended, but I just don't view it as real (in the same sense that everyone else seemingly does). I don't consider an ex to be my  first love,  if that makes sense - because I just don't see it that way.  I guess I could count as a hopeless romantic because it ties into the whole  love conquers all  debate, but ehhhh - I explain more below what I think on each situation.  The overall thought bubble is this: if you ever fall out of love/stop being with them, you/they never loved them/you to begin with.  The way I see it, there are a few schools of thought: one is lust/the honeymoon phase, which is obvious. You stop  loving  them because you never loved them to begin with.  The other is that the love faded, which essentially means that they/you changed, but I would argue that people don't change. You just peel more and more of their layers back, so I would say that you only  loved  one layer of them, which I also don't think is authentic love.  The other is unrequited love, and I believe if it isn't requited, it isn't really love. It might be painful, it might hurt on the other person's end, but I don't see it as authentic love.  I believe you can care about the person, that you can have really intense feelings for them, but I don't see it as love. I believe you can view the relationship as beneficial, as something you learned from, but I don't see it as being authentic.  Now in terms of being with someone, that's more of a gray area. Obviously if the person is abusive - leave them. Run. But then again, I'd argue if they were abusive, it wasn't actually love to begin with. If someone cheated, I just don't think they loved the other person to begin with.  Relationships fall apart for various reasons, but every relationship is effort - if they/you don't really maintain the effort, how much do you really love the person? If the love  fades,  is it really the love fading, or is it you discovering that you never fully loved them (you just thought you loved layers/parts of them).  I mean, is it wrong to love this way? Is it toxic? Or is just different from the majority of the population?",1

I'm actually so nervous and scared, but surprisingly I don't feel scared for how things will evolve between us because i know she'll always be by my side, I'm scared because I'm not out to anyone yet. those days I'm even doubting I've ever even liked boys in the first place.  basically, things are still changing, but I'm proud of myself. i never would have done this years ago. I'm not sure how it'll go, but i know I'm loved by many people in my life nevertheless.  TL;DR: after she cut things off with a guy, i confessed my feelings to my best friend, we didn't do anything about it yet but she said it's reciprocal.",1

We got together a couple of times but he made it clear he did not want a relationship so I decided I had to move on. I ended up dating someone else for a year and a half, and during that time J had many many one night stands, but he always seemed to have a soft spot for me and looked out for me whenever he could (we went to university together so I saw a lot of him - he'd walk me home, kiss me on the forehead on nights out, send me oufits he thought I'd look good in, send me my horoscope if it was interesting). However I also noticed he seemed to have flirtatious connections with other women we hung out with too, even ones in relationships. When my relationship eventually ended, J contacted me and confessed that he cared a lot for me. I didn't return his feelings because it didn't feel respectful to my recent ex given we all knew each other, even though deep down I still cared for J. I then found out through a mutual friend that J was sleeping with another girl in the friendship group, and that they were basically 'together' - all while he'd been confessing his feelings to me. I was totally pissed off and done with his bullshit, so I blocked him and didn't speak to him for two years. He ended up dating the girl from the friendship group for a year during that time (which also happened to be lockdown, and they lived together). He tried to contact me through mutual friends four times during that time, including while he was in a relationship, and the fourth time I was going through a new breakup and decided to respond sort of on a careless whim. He sent me a gift and apology note in the mail, asked to see me, ended up travelling several hours to me. He took me out to dinner, told me he wanted to be with me and was thinking about marriage. I made it clear I couldn't be with him given the trust issues he had created, and told him if anything happened between us it would be far in the future. (That being said, him and I are so similar in the way we think and our interests that I knew I still had feelings for him). He agreed it would best for us to wait until we were both in a place where we could make a relationship work, and expressed he wanted to work on his commitment issues (he had cheated on his previous ex). We left it at that. He then started contacting me monthly, essentially trying to woo me every time. I've now told him to stop, because the whole situation is so draining.  I'm generally quite a sensible person and I can see how this guy hasn't been consistent with his feelings with me which makes me doubt his trustworthiness. But at the same time he seems to expend so much energy on me, which I have never seen him do with another woman, and in the spirit of trusting actions not words that seems to suggest something? My friends and mother have even started trying to get me to be with him, because of how long this has gone on - they think its super romantic. I've tried to uphold my boundaries with this man for so long, and so much has happened its become an exhausting confusing mess. I can't stop thinking about it and trying to unpick it. What would you suggest I do?    TL;DR: I have loved a man for years whos been pretty inconsistent with me, but I can't help but have a soft spot for him and feel that he's genuine. Am I being delusional? Please help me figure out how to move forwards.",1
ThrowRATooSensitiv,Is my GF (23F) too critical or am I (23F) too sensitive?,46,14gcw31,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14gcw31/is_my_gf_23f_too_critical_or_am_i_23f_too/,54,2023-06-22 19:44:10,relationships,"Throwaway to be safe. Also, apologies for the long block of text, I just need informed advice.  My gf and I have been together about 3 years. I love her very much, she's an amazing person with many wonderful qualities, and I cherish and love most things about our relationship.  That being said, my girlfriend is a very particular person. She likes things done a certain way, and has a hard time accepting that other people's ways of doing things are just different and aren't always wrong. I, on the other hand, am a very passive person, and have a more go-with-the-flow approach to life. My girlfriend has an issue with this, and it feels like she always has issues with the way I do things in general. Sometimes it feels like not a day goes by where she isn't criticizing me for something, and it's starting to affect my self esteem.  The thing is, the criticisms she brings up have validity sometimes. For example, she wants me to be more assertive in conflict, she wants me to care more about my appearance and dress better, she wants me to be less shy, etc. I also have ADHD, so I can be forgetful or absentminded sometimes, and I know it grates on her as a detail-oriented person. I don't want to be one of those bummy partners that their girlfriend feels like they have to baby, but another part of me feels defensive, like she's being too picky with me.  It's not just those things either; it's also smaller things. If I'm cooking she takes over because I wasn't stirring correctly, or I'm not cleaning as I go. If I'm cleaning she doesn't like the direction I sweep in or how much paper towel I'm using. If we're walking in public I'm moving too slowly or too quickly or I'm not aware enough of my surroundings. If I fall back and let her take the reigns since I'm doing everything wrong, she gets frustrated that she has to do everything and says I need to be better at taking initiative.  Since I'm a passive person, I also feel like I'm less likely to say something when she makes small mistakes or does mildly irritating things, which makes it more irritating for me when she criticizes me for them. In my mind, it's not that serious for there to be a comment made every time I do something in a way she doesn't like. I don't feel like I'm a total disaster, and yeah I have areas to improve but am I really that bad? But on the other hand, who am I to tell her the way she feels about things isn't that big of a deal? Also, I also grew up with kind of neglectful parents, so I've always been kind of okay with things being less than comfortable or perfect. I know that could also be skewing my perspective on what is or isn't a good way to do things.  I know my girlfriend loves me, but it feels like I just annoy her all the time with the way she's always bringing things up. I also don't want her to censor herself or feel like she can't speak up when something I'm doing is bothering her, and I don't want to make her feel like she's over critical if the issue is that I'm just bad at taking criticism (and I've always been a bit hypersensitive to criticism).  I've spoken to her once or twice about how I feel, but I tend to back down quickly from the conversation because I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong and I'm this incompetent partner that most people would find to be frustrating to deal with. Like part of me feels like she's being more patient with me than I deserve, and I could be pushing my luck by complaining.  This is my first serious relationship, so I'm not sure if it's normal for a partner to always bringing up areas for you to grow or if she's doing too much. Am I being oversensitive, or is this really an issue? If so, how do I handle it without creating a situation where my gf doesn't speak up when she's irritated and gets resentful instead?  TL;DR My girlfriend is a very particular person, and the amount she criticizes me is starting to get to me, but I'm not sure if that's an issue or if the issue is that I'm a frustrating person.",1

It was more mutual because I was really going through alot of depression and anxiety which was affecting us moving forward. I have a big problem with self sacrifice and just not catering to my needs. We both made mistakes that really came down to communication problems. It ended with alot of hugging and saying sorry to each other. It seems like there is room for reconciliation nased on what we've both said to each other.   I still love this girl to death and I feel like I logically think about it all now. Like a fog lifted from my mind. It was like I was extremely sick. I feel terrible about leaving but at the time I felt like it was the only option. We did therapy together and individually. We both needed to figure out alot of our individuality and do personal growth.   I really want to reach out and tell her that I want to try again but I'm afraid of harming this time where we need to work on ourselves. No contact period right now because we had talked after the break up. I know it takes time, but my anxiety is driving me nuts.

My self-esteem is rock bottom but I can't ask him to help because he wants me to leave him alone/stop demanding from him. We've spoken and argued a lot and he says he is in love still and would not have moved in with me if he didn't. I've explained that the lack of intimacy and anger is really concerning me, and I feel undesired. The other day he mentioned going away for our anniversary in a few months and it felt like the first real gesture of love I'd had in weeks. However, he's back to his grouchy snappy self again.  I'm usually quite an independent, self reliant person, and I know I need to get that back but im losing the will to live. Is this the end?  Edit: I should have titled this partner is ignoring my pleas to be looked after while my self-esteem is low. He tells me I'm being needy instead. I really am need*ing* some love right now  Tldr: My partner is growing increasingly cold and resentful. I want things to improve but I don't know how.",1

We can also chill and do absolutely nothing together, which is something I value in a relationship. I love him and am so happy whenever I get to spend time with him. It helps that we were close friends for a long while before we started to date.      When we're not with each other (we don't live together), I am also happy and generally enjoy my time to myself. I've done a lot of work on myself through therapy and though I was once someone with an anxious attachment, I've since become a lot more securely attached to my boyfriend and have learned how to manage my anxiety and mood swings.      In other words, I'm happy when I'm with him and I'm happy when I'm chilling by myself/with my friends. But the only worry/fear that I can't shake off is that he may never be able to open up about his feelings and become emotionally available due to all his past (and current) trauma. Due to his baggage, he's learned to operate on logic and he'll use logic and even anger to mask more vulnerable emotions. I know that he cares about me and enjoys hanging out with me, and that he'll logically rationalize that it's best to keep dating me for those reasons. But I don't know if he'll ever feel love for me?      I'm not sure if I'm placing too much emphasis on the concept of love. Maybe I should just be content with what I have since I love him. Or maybe I should be less selfish and let him go so that he can potentially find a woman he can truly love.   Has anyone ever been in a similar relationship? Did the relationship work out or did you end up regretting it?      Some added context about our relationship:     * He has never said  I love you  in the almost 3 years we've been together, though I do feel he deeply cares about me from his actions and the way he sometimes looks at me. * He has cheated on me in the past (sexted other women online) when we were going through a rough period in which he started to resent me and my previous anxiety issues. Since then, I've worked on my anxiety and he's started going to therapy again. I don't fully trust him to stick to our relationship boundaries but I do believe that it's highly unlikely he will violate them again (as it'd be illogical to throw away our great relationship as it is now). * We don't talk specifics when it comes to a future together; because of some external factors, it's unlikely we'll start discussing the idea of marriage for another couple years or so when those external factors are resolved. * He is more open to me than he is to anyone else (aside from his therapist, perhaps). He'll tell me about his day at work, his hangouts with his friends, his phone calls with his family, etc. but he never talks about his feelings - he just talks about what happened aka the facts. The only emotions I see regularly are frustration/anger when he's venting about work, etc.",1
quandraphobia,"My [31F] platonic love for my best friend [30F] mightve strayed beyond that, and its opened up a long term issue for me with a disconnect between love and sex",2,141soco,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/141soco/my_31f_platonic_love_for_my_best_friend_30f/,2,2023-06-05 21:34:46,relationships,"My best friend [30F] and I [31F] would both describe ourselves as straight. Shes sexually and romantically confident in her attraction to guys, though has slept with a woman and enjoyed it. I also have slept with a woman once, and found it... fine, but didnt really do anything for me. I have on the other hand slept with enough men over the years to know without doubt that I enjoy sex with them. But i've never fallen in love with one. My relationships tend to be 2-4 months of dating before they fizzle out when we get to the stage of deciding whether to take things up a level. Sometimes its them whos not interested, which tends to be quite soon in, whereas if it makes it past the month mark its almost always me who just cant find the interest to continue after a few months. I have known im like this my whole adult life, and tried so many times to work through it. Inevitably though I realise I am forcing myself to feel, and accept that its not fair on the guy to lead him on any longer. I've always known I need to do something about it, but other things have taken priority. Now that im in a stable position, going into my thirties though, its all coming to the surface again.  So my friend recently met a guy in a bar while we were out one night. Hes really nice, chatted away to me plenty and didnt make me feel like a third wheel. They then went out for a dinner date last night, and I got overcome with this breath of melancholy sadness when i got a text from her in the early hours telling me how well it had gone. They're off to spend the day together, and I just stood in the shower for 20 minutes crying this morning.  I love her more than anyone, but I am certain I am not sexually attracted to her. I have asked myself so many times over the years if I could be, because that would make understanding this easy, but I just dont get excited by the idea of it. I cant work out if I really just love her just platonically as i've told myself for years, or if i'm going to feel this sadness at her meeting a great guy that this has crossed into some sort of unhealthy asexual romantic fantasy. Of course any romantic partner who comes into her life is going to become number 1; thats how it works and I'm not trying to bargain against that. Whatever this feeling is, I know I need to work on myself here, but im confused about where to start unpicking all this.  A bit of context: We met 3 years ago through briefly working at the same place at a funny time in both our lives, just as she was getting back on her feet after the messy end of a 5 year relationship and I was finally working through something horrible that happened to me many years prior (Shes the first person I ever told about that in fact). We were good friends without being best friends for the first year, then had a stupid falling out that stung harder than either of us expected it to, and so did the work to reconcile where previously I would have probably just rolled my eyes and let things die, and she said the same. After that is when we really became super close. We go on holiday together, share a bed when one of us crashes at the others after a night out, share our deepest thoughts and secrets etc etc. Our friends call us wives, and we play that up for entertainment. I began to realise about a year ago that I was platonically in love with her. A couple of months back, she off hand floated the idea of us both selling our tiny flats and pooling our money into house sharing somewhere actually nice, and reaping the benefits of not being single income hosueholds. Its come up again a couple of times since in a more serious  lets genuinely think about this  way. I think theres a lot of practical considerations that would probably make it not a great idea, but I've realised that ive let myself get carried away by the rose tinted fantasy of it. The thought of spending even more time with the person in the world I feel understands me better than anyone is very easy to indulge in when your minds wandering.  Its bringing me to look at this impasse I feel I have when it comes to loving sexual partners. Its feels like for me finding a partner is like trying to build a four legged table with only two legs; where I cant feel love for the people I am physically attracted to (men), but cant feel physical attraction to the people I seem to love (women). I think therapy is definitely the route forward, but I havent got a clue what to look for in a therapist here. I have had positive experience of therapy before to deal with the fallout of very objective  things that have happened , whereas here this feels more like an intangible inherent to who I am issue.  Is there a particular style of therapist I should look for here? Is a relationship therapist the right thing, or perhaps even someone who specialises in sexuality? Also, as this may take a while to find a route forward through therapy, in the meantime is my dynamic with my friend straying into unhealthy, and what could I do to address, without just becoming distant?   TLDR: What I thought was a platonic love for a friend but might not be has opened up a lingering feeling of disconnect between love and attraction for me. What should I look for in a therapist, and what can I do to keep things healthy in the meantime? 0 comments Comment as quandraphobia",1

Just being able to talk to her, listen to her interests, and get lost in her pretty face. This sense of companionship, you feel strong and secure when she’s around me. I want to be able to give to her, surprise her with gifts, help her with any issues and be a good listener. It feels magical, and I haven’t felt this way in a long time. Maybe I may meet someone someday, maybe not, but holy smokes, it must be really amazing. But for now, this feeling makes me want to give love to everyone around me, my friends, my family, stray cats and even random strangers. :D  I hope everyone’s having a good day, and hope love is flourishing everywhere :3",1

We met a year ago at a conference and really hit it off. We're both authors. I published my first novel at two years ago and this year used it to land myself a spot in an Ivy League double-majoring creative writing and journalism. Woohoo!      So we met at this conference and stayed in touch since then. But I turned eighteen four months ago and with that has come a lot of realizations. Namely, I can't stop thinking about him. Ever. I've toyed with the idea that maybe it's just admiration for someone very successful in my chosen career, but everything anyone has ever told me about being in love matches up perfectly with how I feel about him, and I can't take it anymore.      We're in very different stages of life. I'm starting out my college education, meanwhile he's touring the country doing conferences and book signings for his fourth novel and getting interviews and full-page spreads in literary magazines. But despite this, I can't stop thinking about how perfect we would be together. I've dropped hints a few times that maybe I feel a little something for him, and he's never totally shut me down.      Then comes the problem of our mutual friends both in and out of the industry; they see us as siblings. They're constantly making fun of me for clinging to him like  his little sister  and that's certainly not a wonderful dynamic to seem to have with someone you're hopelessly in love with.      So Reddit, what do I do? I don't want to ruin our friendship, but I've been desperately pining for my much older friend for months. I've tried to look at other fish in the sea, but the only ones that catch my eye are the people who look like him. I'm taking hopeless romantic to a new level. Do I tell him and risk ruining our friendship, or suffer in silence? I'm lost here.  TL;DR: I'm super in love with an older friend of mine and don't know if I should tell him",1

We both live an active lifestyle. However there are some significant incompatibilities bw us that is making me wonder if love is not enough in this situation.   For example, my bf currently works in construction, and he desperately does not want to work anymore. He is not a lazy person in general, he just does not like working for money. I work in a corporate environment and make more money than him. While I don’t love working, I have accepted working for the majority of my life as a likely reality. He repeatedly has said that he would like to be a stay at home dad, and other related comments painting a future of me being the sole provider. I have expressed to him over and over that I do not want this responsibility and that I want to function as a team in terms of everything- working, maintaining a living space, building together.   My bf also wants to leave CA, but I really do not want to leave. I grew up in CA, my family and friends are here, and in spite of the cost I love living here. Also noting that my bf and I do not live together, he lives w his family currently to save money bc does not want to rent an apt, he wants to buy a house.   Recently we had a conversation about having kids, in which he said that he is ready and I told him I won’t be ready for another few years. I asked him questions like how would raising a kid together look? Especially if we moved out of state, and did not have family or friends to help with childcare, how would we manage the costs? He asserted that if he puts money down on a house for us then he thinks it would be fair for me to be the sole financial provider for him and a child at least in the short term. I don’t really believe that he means short term bc he has expressed so many times that he does not want to work. This did not sit right w me and really drove home the question for me of whether love is enough to sustain this relationship.   We unquestionably love each other and we support each other in so many ways. But when it comes to a lot of the practical side of building a life together I have doubts. I overthink things but he is on the opposite end and does a lot of things impulsively. Are our incompatibilities things that are worth compromising on? Is love enough and am I just overcomplicating things? We’ve had so many conversations about these topics but have not reached any resolutions or changes.",1

He moved in because his living conditions at home were bad. We were really close emotionally and physically. It was the best time I ever had in my life with someone. I started to slowly fall in love with him but I didn't say anything about it. We were affectionate to each other and that felt like enough. We had some roommate drama that made them anxious which is understandable. We moved but one of those roommates stayed with us due to financial issues. Recently they said they no longer wanted to be physically affectionate with me because they get anxiety from our roommate (Although they still give lots of hugs). They said they aren't sure if they'll ever feel like being able to do that again. I understand but it has me completely heart broken. I would never disrespect their decision and I only want them to feel comfortable. Our friendship hasn't really changed but it hasnt stopped me from feeling utterly gut wrenched. I am devastated. I never told them how I felt, and I guess I'm glad I didnt. At this point I'm afraid of outright rejection and ruining our friendship. He said he didnt want our friendship to change because he loves it so much which is why he made that decision. Again, I understand where hes coming from. I just am totally heart broken. There had been so many moments where I felt like I could live the rest of my life with him by my side forever. I feel like the physical disconnect may hinder that. But, to be fair, I know I'm not entitled to that. He doesn't even know how strong my feelings are. I feel like I will need to have a large shift in my emotional thinking for me to continue, which I'm willing to do. I'm just so distraught right now. I'm not sure what I should do to pick myself back up. It makes me feel like I got greedy and entitled and everything came crashing down on me. He lives in my room, so I feel like I can't get away to have my own emotions.  What can I do to heal and go back to feeling normal?  I love him so much I'd do anything for him, including swallowing all of these feelings to have a friendship with him. Is that unhealthy? Is there any advice I can get for handling this situation?  Part of me feels like they may be in love with me too, but I feel like maybe I am delusional for thinking that.

I’ve also said that this need would be met if it happened once or twice a month, not everyday. He is much more an acts of service guy, so does most of the chores at home, gives me a massage whenever I request one spends time with my friends and family etc. I have voiced what I want several times and he is always really understanding and validating but nothing changes and his reason for this is that he just forgets. A month ago he said he would set reminders and he has since had it go off twice, but he hit snooze and forgot about them again, also stating that he had something going on at the time so couldn’t do something for me right then and there.

Our dads have always been friends, so we sometimes would hang out together with other friends. When we were kids, the 3-year age gap created an almost big sister-like dynamic so I never thought of her in a romantic way.   Currently: I go to school far away now and have seen her every summer in the past couple years. Every summer I and my dad take on her and her dad in pool (billiards). We're all really even and always have a great time together. Her being older and having a boyfriend made me only look at her as a friend. Until now, she no longer has a boyfriend and our age gap is less relevant as we're both adults. We get along really well and make each other laugh. I've only seen her twice this summer, but each time she hugs me when she leaves, something she didn't do when she had the bf. I'm not the most socially aware but I do think that she sees me a bit differently now. On top of liking her as a friend, I think she's hot, beautiful, sexy. I'm decently attractive myself and feel confident that she at least is somewhat attracted to me.      The problem: Here's the thing, nowadays I only see her when she's with her dad and I don't have any opportunity for 1on1 time with her. The only way I could ask her out or make some kind of move is via phone. And on top of that, I'm only going to be in town for 3 weeks, so I couldn't start an actual relationship. It would be short-term if anything at all.      I don't want to ruin our friendship by trying to take things further. At the same time I want her, badly.      My options seem, to me, to be:      Do nothing and just remain friends, maybe the time will be right in the future.      Message her and see if she'd like to go on a date together, it could make things awkward but I may never see her again, who knows where our respective careers will take us.      Make a move in person, which I would do if we could get any alone time. I don't know how to socially engineer that situation, and doing that feels kinda weird.      Any advice? What would you do?",1

We do have two small children. For the last 7 years he has supported me in going back to school to become a lawyer. I finished my bachelors and I am now about to go into my final year of law school. I work 40 hours a week, I travel 3 hours round trip three nights a week for law school. Next semester will be 4 nights a week. I am doing the best I can between work, school, being an amazing mommy and wife.      Our past has been extremely rocky, he has cheated on me at least two times that im aware of. He also has a drinking problem and would drink a 12 pack of beer every single night and get smashed and I was left to take care of the kids, bathtime, jammies, bedtime etc. When I started traveling for law school I was afraid to leave the kids in his care because he would pass out on the couch drunk. He got help, we did counseling and he stopped drinking except Friday and Saturday nights either at the house or with our friends but he never really got stupid drunk anymore so i was happy. I am not a saint in this marriage, I had an affair during his drinking addiction, i do not condone my actions and I know i hurt him but i was angry and lonely for his actions. This was all 4 or more years ago for both of us.      Now 5 1/2 months ago my whole world started to crash. We almost lost our house, our cars, everything we had worked so hard for all these years because he traded one addiction for another. He had a gambling addiction and was blowing his whole paychecks on gambling. He wasnt paying the mortgage, car payments, car insurance, nothing. I had gotten some money back from school so I bailed him out almost $10,000 in January. By March he was stealing money from me again. I woke up on our sons birthday and saw 600 dollars gone out of the bank account. I was going to leave then but he convinced me to stay. A month later I found out that he was in trouble at work and spent over $9,000 on his work credit card. He apparently isnt going to lose his job but has to pay it all back plus get our mortgage and car payments all caught up so we dont lose everything.      I left and stayed at my moms for 3 weeks and he convinced me to come home and i did because i missed him, our house, our life and wanted things to be normal for the children. I have been back in the house now for about 3 weeks and things just arent the same. He was angry at me for leaving and told a bunch of people i left him with nothing, begging them for money because i apparently took everything when all i did was cut him off from the bank account. He has since taken over 300 dollars again since I moved back in, he has an excuse each time of having to pay someone back but that he isnt gambling but i dont believe it anymore. He did start seeing a gambling counselor and got a second job to help with the bills. I sleep with my wallet everynight, i changed the PIN on my bank card, removed him from the bank account but we are constantly fighting still because im angry, he is angry and while ill always love him and care about him as a person, i dont know if i should leave for good or if any part of this can be salvaged anymore.      TLDR; Should I leave the marriage and try to move on with my life? Do I try to make it work for the kids? Is it possible to trust him ever again?",1

Now after we both have graduated, he is working and I am pursuing a master degree however I feel like I'm falling out of love.  To start off I met him through a friend, he wasn't really my type but I have fallen in love with his personality, he makes me laugh, we have a lot in common and when I look at him I find him beautiful.  However the past year I have been feeling less loved. We both only see each other 3 days a week, but we try to make it up when we are together. He isn't much of a physical touch guy and I rarely receive compliments (often having to ask for them). The amount of true  I love you's  I have had I can almost count on one hand.  It didn't bother me that much during most of our relationship, he made up for it with acts of services, so I really appreciated the effort he put into it. However lately it has been bothering me more. I sometimes feel like we are just comfortable in the relationship but the love part has dwindled.   When I tried to bring this up in conversation it felt like he wasn't really listening to me and he mentioned that's not how it was like growing up in his household, he has trouble expressing his emotions and why did I bring it up after so many years. Afterwards he did give me a few compliments as we got dressed up to go somewhere but I know that by next week things might just go back to how they were.  I still love him, and the thought of leaving him hurts... But I don't know if this is what I really want for myself, especially since he wants to move in together after I finish my degree. Any advise is appreciated because I don't know how to handle going forward any more.  TLDR: I'm feeling less loved because of a lack of physical affection & compliments but I don't know if he can or is willing to improve this part of our relationship.",1
katiedababie,I (21F) found a spy camera in my room after my step dad (36M) put a surveillance camera in my window,8169,14c0udv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14c0udv/i_21f_found_a_spy_camera_in_my_room_after_my_step/,926,2023-06-17 20:27:18,relationship_advice,"My stepdad (36M) installed a surveillance camera positioned outside of my window to scan our backyard while him and my mother and two younger brothers go camping. I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks.   For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in.   I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.  I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him.   My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.  TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?  UPDATE(1/?):  I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present.   As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.  This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.  UPDATE (2/?)  it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.  again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.  UPDATE (3/?)  i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.  after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened. (she was stuck with him and my brothers about 4 hours away for the weekend)   i’m hoping with my aunt there and her being away from my stepdad that it’ll prevent her from reacting out of anger and search for him and escalate the situation then and there, and i hope my aunt can provide some support for myself and her. i’m prepared for her to go through the same processes i went through such as reasoning and denial, but with the evidence there’s no possible way she can deny it. i’m preparing myself for the worst. i just hope that i can be strong for her and support her as this all hits her like it did me.   i will not be returning home or facing him today. my boyfriend will be on standby to pick up my brothers if needed since my aunt has offered for them to stay with us so my mom can talk to my stepdad without them there. i’ll ask my mom to meet me and of course, not tell my stepdad about the circumstances. maybe she can tell him she’s going to the grocery store. i don’t want him getting any hints that she could be meeting with me.   i know i’ve said it a lot but i truly do appreciate the support system i have not only with my family but here too. this has been a nightmare but hearing everyone’s stories about this, proving it’s way too common, is what is helping me get through this and pushing me to do the right thing. not only am i a victim in this but my boyfriend as well and god knows who else. the confrontation won’t happen for about another 7 hours so i’m the meantime i’ll be reading over comments and preparing myself for what comes today. thank you guys.",1

Iwant to tell him I love him but he isn't great at expressing his emotions so I don't want him to feel pressured in anyway if I were to say it first... I've held my tongue and been patient but sometimes I think he's never going to say it.   Whenever I tell him he is special to me or compliment him, he gets uncomfortable and makes jokes to change the subject. I know words of affirmation are not his love language, but they are mine so l've asked if there is anything I can do to make him feel more comfortable expressing himself to me or having me express myself to him. He says there's nothing but that he shows affection to me other ways, which is true, but there are still 3 words I seem to be forever longing to say to him.

In my head we have been solid and supportive of eachother. We both found good jobs and even adopted a dog together. We have had the talks about marriage and kids and have the same mindset on both and have talked about our future together enough to make me feel so committed and solid about our relationship.   Not everyday is smooth, but I thought that’s just how relationships go, she has bad anxiety and decided to do therapy and go back on medication within the last two months, the meds seem to slow down her sex drive, but I’m okay with it because at the end of the day they are helping her get through all her days without having anxiety attacks. Moving to the new city has added a few more stresses to our lives but I still always tried to make time to do things for our relationship.  The other day she dropped the bomb on me that she is struggling being in a relationship right now, she says she doesn’t know what it’s like to be alone and feel independent, and that even though she thinks I’m a really good boyfriend and that I do so much for her and us, it’s how’s she been feeling. She says she hates that she feels that way because she loves me still and would never want to hurt me but once she started thinking about how she doesn’t feel independent she couldn’t shake the thought.  She then left out town for the weekend with a friend to get alittle space and I had never felt more sick in my life, I tried to convince her that we can work on those things while still in a relationship and that if we broke up all of our hopes and dreams go out the window, she came back today and feels more distant than ever and me more sick than ever, I want to work through this because I have always felt that she was the one I was going to go through life with and I don’t know if I can handle life if she’s not in it anymore.  I also don’t know what I would do because we make things work financially together and I don’t know many people in this city. Idk how I could afford to live by myself  Please help, I feel sick I havnt ate in days and I feel so hopeless and full of dread",1
ThrowRA_10567,My (25F) boyfriend (28m) says my boundary is controlling,2717,147xuf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/147xuf4/my_25f_boyfriend_28m_says_my_boundary_is/,853,2023-06-12 21:13:06,relationship_advice,"My (25f) boyfriend (28M) says my boundary of not wanting to be with someone who goes to strip clubs is controlling. I’ve explained to him several times that my ex of 3 years had multiple relations with several strippers, and as such it is a hard limit. He said he is grown man, and he can do whatever he wants and doesn’t have to follow the rules of someone else. I said I agree, you’re absolutely allowed to do whatever you want, but I won’t be in a relationship with someone who cannot put my feelings over seeing another woman naked/getting a lap dance. I told him this before things even got serious with us, and he said he didn’t want to go to one anyways, so it was fine and he understood. Now all of a sudden, I’m trying to control him. I don’t think I am. I never said “you’re not allowed to go to a strip club,” I said it was a boundary of mine, and if it is something he feels he needs to do, then we can just go our separate ways. It wasn’t even a threat, because we weren’t even serious. He brought it up a few days ago, that he wants to go for his friend’s birthday. I reminded him of my boundary, that he agreed to because we became exclusive, and he told me that his boundary was not to be with someone who controls him.   I said “I’m not trying to control you, but if that’s a boundary for you, that’s fine and we can end things now. My boundary will not change.” He replied that he doesn’t want to end things. And I just reiterated that he can’t go to a strip club and also have me. It’s just a hard boundary I don’t foresee myself ever going back on. I feel like he is trying to push me to throw my boundary out the window, but I know for a fact I won’t feel good about it. We’ve only been together for 6 months, so at this point I really think it would just be less of a headache of cut things off. I care about him, but I’m not interested in being a “cool” girlfriend who pretends I’m totally fine with something I find extremely disrespectful. He thinks I’m being irrational, I think it’s kind of messed up he is trying to push against something, again, I warned him about before agreeing to be his girlfriend. Thoughts?  TLDR: Boyfriend wants to go to a strip club against my hard boundary, but doesn’t want to break up to do so, and says I just shouldn’t be controlling.    !!UPDATE!!  I got sick of commenting the same thing over and over again. He came over, we spoke and he said he was definitely 100% going, a private room was booked, he was getting lap dances, and I’d just have to be okay with it. I told him I was not okay with it, and if he really wanted to go I wouldn’t stop him, but I also wouldn’t continue the relationship with him. He knew I considered it cheating, and was basically asking my permission to cheat on me. I broke up with him in the end, he called me crazy (something he know is a trigger), and left. About an hour after the break up he was calling and texting me. His texts flip flopped between “you’re being crazy” to “I love you please talk to me baby”. And then eventually I was a “crazy bitch”.   Around 4:30 am, he used my hidden key to enter my apartment, and I was woken up to him crawling into my bed and crying that he didn’t think I’d actually dump him. Crazy, he knew from the beginning, agreed to the boundary, and expected me to just drop it since we had an emotional attachment? Not happening.   Then, a few hours later he texted me about how it was all made up because he wanted to see my reaction. There is no strip club party, he just wanted to see how I’d react if it ever came up in the future. He wasn’t expecting me to actually break up with him. This wasn’t any better than there actually being a strip party in my opinion. This might actually be worse. He wanted to see how far he could push my boundary, to see if I’d let him cross it. Although I’m not sure I believe him anyways, he said it’s a regular bar party, and I’m invited but why wait hours and after a breakup to admit it? Maybe it’s crazy to assume he spoke to his friend and asked him to cover for him with a “regular party,” and then go to the strip party in secret. But it’s also freaking crazy to make up something just to see if you can get your girlfriend to sacrifice her feelings for your fun.   Either way, I won’t be getting back with him, ever. This was an eye opening experience. My locks are getting changed by maintenance today, and his number is being blocked. I’m too old be playing these middle school games.   As for the comments that said I was punishing my bf for the actions of my ex, wrong. I’ve never ever been okay with this. I’ve always considered naked women rubbing their tits and ass on you to be cheating regardless of where it takes place. I don’t care if it’s normalized by tv, movies, etc. It is not something I am willing to ever tolerate in a partner. I don’t care if it’s seen as controlling either. If you think saying “I won’t tolerate being cheated on, I will leave” is controlling, that’s you. And it’s also why I said it before we entered a relationship. It’s why I worded it “hey, I can tell things are getting serious, before we are exclusive I think going to strip clubs and getting lap dances are cheating. If your ideals don’t align, that’s fine, I won’t try to control you, we just don’t need to pursue a relationship. It’s a boundary I won’t ever cross” He said he was fine with it, they’re stupid, he doesn’t want to go.  He also said male strip clubs are different because male strippers will sleep with women customers for free, but you have to pay for female strippers to do that and he isn’t that type of guy.   UPDATE AGAIN  There was a strip club party 🤣 you all called it. He was lying and planning on going anyways, and it was last night. I made friends with one of their other guy friend’s girlfriend. Her boyfriend declined going, but she told me there absolutely was a strip club party, and my ex did plan to attend. Whatever.",1

TL;DR: i dont know if im being unreasonable because my boyfriend said he loves me but he doesnt necessarily need me.",1

I met him  over 3 years ago he saw me in a Walmart parking lot and followed me to the gas station where he asked for my number , I was in my celibate single phase so I didn’t really give him a chance , but he was consistent so after a while I let him in . And wow did I fall in love , it’s actually crazy to think of how different things were then, he was very loving , he told me he only wanted me and saw a future and marriage with me .   He introduced me to his mom and took me to his grandparents house. We spent alot of time together and had the best sex I’ve ever had in my life .. but he started acting weird and not wanting to spend as much time with me . He would say he was home but his car would not be there .. at some point I started pulling up to his house unannounced because of insecurity.  which led to our breakup apparently,  I’m the reason he’s mean because I “don’t understand nice “   I chased him for months and he would never answer the phone until I gave up. 3 months later he wrote me saying he wants to apologize. I didn’t want to hear it so I ignored him for a while until I finally caved . He made it seem like we would be in a relationship with me and he would make up for everything . So we reconnected … I guess it was a mistake .   I came over his house . He should have took me out somewhere to talk but instead I slept over and we made love . And that seems to be all we do . I would come over we would talk watch tv and have sex and then I would leave with him in the morning when he was leaving for work .  Again,  I started feeling insecure and driving by his house ( I know it was wrong ) he was still lying about being home he ended telling me that I’m not his girlfriend and he can do whatever he wants . To stop calling him because I’m not his “Bi*ch” , that all the other females he talks to knows their place so he doesn’t have to be mean to them .   TL;dr: That he’s having fun and not going to think about settling down until he gets into the Air Force and gets a bonus lol. That I can move with him when he goes but until then he is “having fun “ on top of that Everytime we are intimate he does not pull out so now I’m afraid I’m pregnant and I feel so embarrassed and hurt right now I have nobody to talk to . I can’t believe I let another human being treat me like this and make me feel this way . I guess he thinks I won’t leave no matter how mean he is . Or maybe he just never cared . Idk what to do . I just feel broken and sad . Why do I still love him ?",1

We met at college as freshmen and I honestly only saw him as a friend at first and wasn’t attracted to him and it was clearly mutual but since then we’ve gotten extremely close and I’ve slowly started to develop deep feelings for him because honestly he is the most sweetest and most caring guy I’ve ever met and I’m honestly enamored.   It’s tragic because he’s clearly not attracted to me because he always tells me about girls he’s interested in and I just support him along and always give him unbiased advice that will help him get with girls he’s interested in.   I’m in so much emotional pain because I know he will never feel this way towards me. Those girls have no idea how lucky they are to capture his attention. He’s even explicitly stated that he’s such a great guy friend because he only views his female friends platonically - and I believe this to be true because he has never flirted with me.   I’m in emotional pain. I do not want to lose him as a friend whatsoever. But this hurts bad and honestly negatively impacts my self esteem.

We met when I was 18 and he was 20. We ended up in different cities for four years, before covid and were quite on and off for a bit before things became serious again.    The thing is, even though I love him to bits and cannot imagine leaving him, I do not want to sleep with him or even kiss him. I’m just not attracted to him looks wise. He has a great body and everything and I consider myself a 6 at best. But every time we sleep together I find myself staring at the wall waiting for it to be over. I don’t get turned on by him. Whenever he kisses me I feel like pulling away.  I avoid meeting him when he shaved his beard because it makes him look so unattractive in my eyes. It makes me unreasonably angry when he shaves so much so just looking at his face makes me want to cry. I can’t help but feel like a horribly pathetic and shallow human being for feeling this way about a man I love.    This is a man who knows me inside out. He has been my best friend and favourite person since we met in 2013. His family loves me and mine loves him. And for the most part we have a great time together laughing, making jokes and I LOVE hanging out with him. But I do not want to kiss him or make love to him anymore.

We are a happy couple most of the time and have a lot of fun and love. I feel he loves me and I think he shows this a lot. And I show him a lot too through my actions and words.  However we do fall out from time to time and I do think he can be selfish sometimes and I will sometimes point this out to him and he gets very defensive and so I will usually just let it go and we get on as normal.  However I had a work trip away and I asked him to join me which he didn't mind as it suited him as he wanted to go and see some sites for himself. However it meant that he would miss an extra shift at work where there was potential for him to make some good money, he swapped the shift for another extra shift but unfortunately he didn't make much on it. However the shift he missed becuase he traveled with me his work colleague let him know he missed out on a good amount of pay as they were out working all day.  He text me a screenshot of the message his friend from work sent to him, and said how he feels shit as he could have really done with that money as he said he was concerned about money.  I naturally felt really bad and I said I would give him some of my pay from the money I made working away and I sent him 500 through the bank. Once he got home I greeted him with a hug and kiss and said I hope he's ok and I apologised that he had missed out on the money.  He said he didn't want the 500 I sent and that it makes him feel even worse! And I said no I don't mind I want to help him especially if he's struggling for money and missed out because of me. But he then said in a spiteful way for me to have it back to go towards my boob job I want. (I haven't even said I definitely want a boob job I've just mentioned it that I would maybe get one in the future because I said I was insecure about them being saggy after having children) I said that upset me a bit and that I feel insecure about that so it was bit of a spiteful thing to say and he just denied it and walked off. He then came back and told me how much of a shit girlfriend I am and that he can't stand me and that he's not happy and brought up times where we have had disagreements and said he's never been happy and doesn't know if he wants me anymore and that he doesn't even want to come home to me anymore and that he hates being with me.  I was deeply hurt by this as I felt like it literally came out of nowhere, have never known he was unhappy, we always hug and kiss when he gets home, we always laugh and talk about our days, we always show each other love and affection and intimacy and always dote on eachother how much we find eachother attractive and share how much we love our lives together, we go out a lot together and have fun and lots of good trips away etc.  Yes I know we can have disagreements sometimes but I never knew he felt this way so it was a total shock, I cried my eyes out to him and said how I didn't know and how I was sorry he felt this way and I took it all as it was all my fault. But I said he clearly isn't happy with me and we spoke about breaking up.  This morning he woke up and kissed me and said he was sorry he was just depressed and down about the money and he loves me and wants to be with me forever and then he went out.  But his words cut me so deeply. I don't know what to do?  Thanks for reading!",1

Since the last year/year and a half, I've had thoughts about breaking up only when times were hard and stressful. I always pushed them aside cause I thought it was just an at-the-moment reaction and moved on with no lingering effects. What were the causes of these hard times? Either being tired from work or getting ticked off from something my SO did/didn't do; sometimes both. During the 3 years so far living at our apartment, we've grown and tackled problems together while also getting a dog we both love so much. However, slowly I've taken up most of the housework and financial responsibilities. Name a chore and I probably do it 80% of the time; all the while I'm working full time (40-50 hours/week) whereas she works 20-25hrs/week. As a result, it's been draining me mentally, physically, and financially but I keep doing it cause she's not in the best place right now. In total, I've had reactionary thoughts of breaking up only a handful of times. In terms of us, we rarely/never have arguments and we respect each others' space/privacy. We do our own things, have our own plans with friends, and sometimes just spend the nights relaxing after a long day.   Anyways, I recently heard people talk about whether they're happy or comfortable in their current situation (non-relationship wise). Couple that with me hanging out with friends for the first time in a while (I'm mostly a home body). Have I been dishonest with myself the past 3 years? That's what it feels like being happy when I was out with friends? Is our relationship just comfortable at this point and we're only going through the motions? But I still love her. While going through my epiphany, then comes the thoughts of what happens if we do end it. She's heavily dependent on me financially (HCOL area). I don't want to lose our dog either. The guilt of me developing these emotions is eating me up and blind siding her is the worst thing I want to happen because I'm sure she isn't feeling the same way. Ever since this realization, I've been quieter around the apartment and she's taken notice; I'm not ready to bring it up yet. Am I just tied down to sunk cost fallacy? I guess I'm writing to vent since this is the only outlet I have access to.    TLDR: I'm saddened by the fact that I might what to break it off with my SO of 5 years. We're so intertwined in each other's lives at this point that it's difficult to do so. To avoid a giant wall of text, I'll try to answer anything in the comments. Not sure on what to do from here.",1

Green_Floor4318,Extremely hurtful things were said to me during an argument with my (32f) boyfriend (35m) and I don’t know how to handle it.,516,142u6o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/142u6o8/extremely_hurtful_things_were_said_to_me_during/,217,2023-06-06 21:41:20,relationships,"We have been together for almost 2 years. We got into an argument last night, the details of which are not as important as how badly it escalated. Though I will share for context if needed. What would have been a fight an average couple has likely had at some point eventually became a screaming match on his part, with our house being trashed and me being called the worst things a man could ever say to a woman. Amongst worse things I can’t say here, I was called a piece of shit, moron, idiot, a drunk (because I had had a drink earlier on in the argument to calm my adrenaline). I again want to add that I respectfully asked for space when anger started to show and that only worsened it. nothing was broken in the house except pieces of me mentally, those words cut hard and I laid there in complete disbelief that someone who claimed to love me could seemingly hate everything about me SO much. Every word that came out of his mouth was said with such hatred and disgust. He even said at one point he wanted nothing to do with me or our baby and to get out of his life.   He has since apologized and said he did not mean any of those things, but whether he did or not they absolutely mean something to me. I get that people say hurtful things when they’re upset, anyone can admit that. but I have never been called such horrible things.. his comment about the baby hurts the most. We have never fought this bad before.  I’m realizing that this is a huge red flag, to be called such vile things. And why? Where did it come from except to make me feel low and worthless? I have never cheated nor disrespected our relationship, and have never been a promiscuous woman. I do have options.. either I stay here for the sake of our baby and to keep me from getting an eviction because he won’t key the apartment if I go, and he won’t leave for me to stay. I can go with family, but they are out of state, and with an eviction on my record it would be very difficult to get on my feet again.. I have destroyed my credit during this relationship and the cost of living makes it difficult to get an apartment by myself as it is.  Mentally, I feel very stuck.. part of me is hurt enough to walk out and not care about the consequences financially, but then if my baby has no contact with his father there is huge mom guilt to look forward to, uncertainty to face, grieving to do, possible regret.. I don’t know if a relationship can be repaired after something like this either though or if it just gets worse from here. I feel like I will remember this forever, even if I tried to stay and work it out. I don’t know if the hurt will ever go away. If anyone has any good advice here, I would really appreciate the unbiased opinions. If you were in my shoes, how would you handle this?  TL;DR - extremely hurtful things were said to me during an argument with my boyfriend, and I don’t know if I should stay or go at this point.",1
MysteriousName6634,M20 F22 Artist in love with engineer,2,1461vr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1461vr7/m20_f22_artist_in_love_with_engineer/,9,2023-06-10 14:35:47,relationship_advice,"Hey I'm looking for some advice. I'm an artist, a very creative and very mentally ill one at that (schizoaffective disorder bipolar type, basically mixed episodes of mania and psychosis followed by severe episodes of depression) I have trouble understanding logic or reality at times. Im also autistic and dyspraxic and struggle a lot socially and with adls. I went through a very traumatic time in my life recently and I met a girl who was there to support me. Ive had to deal with mountains of self hate with being late diagnosed and my family being not so nice. She's also autistic, but she's an engineer type, a very left brained person. She's told me she thinks completely in math. She struggles immensely with her self confidence, to the point where she openly says she hates herself and deserves to die. She also tries to help other people on a physical level to ignore her own self hatred and unacceptance of her disability. I am in love with her. I have never loved another human like I love her. She fascinates me because she is so different from me, yet struggles with some of the same things. I cant get her out of my head, and I want so badly to help her in the way she's helped me to love myself more with my disabilities but she can't seem to process my affection emotionally. She can't seem to process anything I say, and the more I push her, the more exasperated and cold she becomes towards me. I get angry at her because I see her as cold and uncaring and she sees me as dramatic and overly emotional, to the point of being childlike, and we cannot find a middle ground. She also never communicates her boundaries, and lets me hurt her emotionally over and over, and I feel like I might have to just... back off somehow. The issue is, I feel dedicated to her because she literally saved my life from impending suicide, and she taught me how to care for myself. I feel guilt and shame and the need to do the same for her, but honestly I have no clue how. I'm not equipped to help someone who is so fundamentally different from me, but the emotional artist in me is saying that i must or my life will not be fulfilled. We are not even officially dating right now, though we used to be for 3 weeks. I know I love her, but she still sees me as a friend, even when she doesn't treat me as one, so im getting mixed signals. I keep telling myself she loves me but doesn't know how to show it, though that seems like narcissistic hypomanic me talking there. Does anyone have advice? I love her and just want her to be well and happy, but I worry ill hurt her more  Thanks",1

She is notorious for taking lots of time to herself to process stuff and she's an introvert. I haven't heard anything from her for over a week, which is out of character for her. I know she's okay, I can see her pop in and out of coverage on find my friends once every other day or so, but she never tells me she's okay, or texts me to tell me she won't be in service for a long time. I know she doesn't need the level of communication I prefer, and she's so lovely when she does call, but it's hard for me to go that long without hearing anything from her. (Background) I was in a (what I thought was an amazing) marriage for 8 years until she left me and took the kids without ever telling me she was unhappy. Now all I can think of is that my girlfriend is scared of me and won't tell me if there's something wrong. don't want to sound needy to her, but I want to let her know it's hard for me to not hear from her. What should I do?  Tl;dr! my gf is a introvert firefighter who takes long communication breaks and it’s really hard for me.",1
blueinyellow,Should I [F20s] continue dating someone [M20s] who will never be able to love me?,2,149h6l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/149h6l6/should_i_f20s_continue_dating_someone_m20s_who/,5,2023-06-14 19:47:03,relationships,"tl;dr Currently dating someone emotionally unavailable. Biggest problems are lack of affection and reassurance, which lead to fights and makes me think I'm not good enough. Asking for third party perspective and advice for further action.   My situation is pretty straight forward, the person I'm romantically involved with has been burned in love and because of that has developed a serious defense mechanism to keep himself protected from further harm. Even though he says he cares about me, he finds any kind of deeper emotion annoying and unnecessary. The lack of romance and warmth in our relationship has been a cause of many fights. I just feel the teasing and making fun of me in daily conversation outweighs the words of affirmation and that makes me feel like he can't stand me. Don't get me wrong I love when we joke around and tease each other, but sometimes it feels like everything I say in a conversation is met with judgment and mocking. Every time I've expressed my concern regarding his rough attitude towards me, which is almost never followed by warm words to bring balance into the dynamic, he brushed it off and told me I'm in the wrong because my first instinct is to assume he wants to hurt me rather than acknowledge that he's just kidding. Basically he told me he doesn't need to reassure me, I just need to assume he cares about me. He once asked me what gives me the right to ask for more reassurance from him. So it's clear he has really distorted view on emotions and how to express them. Other than that he's a very intelligent, thoughtful, capable person and it seems he enjoys my company. He has his own way of showing me he cares and sometimes I feel selfish for  wanting more . It would be nice to hold hands in public from time to time or if he kissed/hugged me just because he felt like it. That would mean the world to me. Unfortunately I can't make him do things he's uncomfortable with. He's doing his best with what he's got. My question is should I just accept the situation and learn how to be okay with the lack of warmth? Because I really care about him and I want to fully accept that part of him. Or should I put my emotions and needs first and find someone more compatible? Every other aspect of our relationship is satisfying. We have similar interests, same outlook on life, both are introverted and enjoy more peaceful activities and I'm afraid I won't find another person like him. I don't know what our future would look like though, because he finds the idea of kids and marriage icky. I'm afraid he'll never truly love me and that makes me spiral sometimes. I also can't help but to obsess with his ex in those occasional moments because she was able to experience everything I long for. It's a shift from seriously discussing names of their future children with her, to him being uncomfortable when I joke about him and I being parents. What should I do? I'm kind of torn here. Is this whole thing a lost cause? Am I being delusional for wanting to make this work? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did that turn out?",1

My husband cheated on me a lot when we use to date but has been great since we got married. I just recently learned (back in December) that he had been yet again, unfaithful. We were having a lot of problems in our marriage when he told me about his infidelity (probably fr guilt and wanting to get it off his chest) but swore it was from before we were married. I did some digging and the timeline was off, it was during our marriage. I confronted him and he froze, then he said nothing happened, and that he actually made the whole thing up. He has asked me to forgive him but I just can’t seem to.  Here is my dilemma, he is the best husband, minus the unfaithfulness. This man is a good father, generous lover, cooks, cleans, works hard, handy, tells me I’m beautiful every day, can’t keep his hands off me, sex every other day, patient, smart, kind, loving, great to my family, treats me like a queen, spoils me rotten, sweet, charming, witty, and gives me daily massages. He is about perfect, but can’t seem to stay faithful to me.  I am also great. I’ve been different since I found out, so I am currently not great BUT before I was everything he asked for. I cooked three course meals, cleaned, devoted mother and wife, sex on demand (when, where, how, even all the kinky stuff), made my own money, have my own business, worked out, played sports, smart, kind, loving, generous, and devoted my whole life to him.  So what happened?  He cheated on me at the worst possible time in my life. I was in the best shape of my life, then I had two strokes, was severely sick with our second child, had to have an abortion, and was recovering from the physical and mental damage.  I am no longer in love with him but I am not sure what to do. We at perfect together, all we need now if money.  Any theories and/or advice on why this happened, what to do, or how to prevent this fr happening again if I stay. Thank you.",1

We dated from the time were 16 to 22. We then broke up for a while but got back together when we were 25. We are both 29 now.   We live together and I know he's going to ask me to marry him soon so I want to get my feelings in order before anything happens. I love him, I really do but I feel sorta unloved. I know once couples become comfortable with each other and live together, the  spark  or whatever dies but I don't like feeling like this.   I still make an effort, I ask him how his day went, I'm affectionate, I  put out  so to speak.   A thing that really bothers me is when I say something, a lot of the time, he ignores me. When I bring it up, he says that he didn't hear me or that he was busy. For example, I'll say  Did you see there's going to be a strike tomorrow?  and I won't get a reply. I'll wait 10 seconds...still no reply. Then I'll ask  hello? Did you hear what I said?'' and he'll go ''hmm  or grunt in response. He does this often, just abrupt responses after ignoring me and me having to repeat myself.   I'd understand if he did this if I was talking his ear off but I'm not even a talkative person. Yet when he talks about anything, I pay attention, respond properly, validate his opinions and reassure him when he needs me to.   Affection wise, I always give him hugs and kisses. He hardly ever does this anymore without me asking. I compliment him and tell him that he looks handsome. He hasn't complimented me in any shape or form in probably over a year now that I think about it...   I still look the same looks wise, I haven't gained weight or anything (not that that's a reason to stop loving someone but you know how some people are) so I don't know what changed. Have things just become stale? Is this what inevitably happens?   This whole situation has been troubling me for a while but I'm not sure what to do. Our anniversary is in two months time and his sister accidentally let it slipped that he's going to propose. If it weren't for that, I'd think that we've been together for too long and he's now sick of me.   I tried talking to a few of my friends who are already married and all I got were varied versions of  that's how men are .   He wasn't like this before. He would pay attention to me, talk to me and overall I just felt more  liked  y'know? Now it just kind of feels one sided...  The one time I attempted to kind of bring it up, I opened with  Do you still like me? Because sometimes it doesn't really feel like it  and he replied with  If I didn't like you, why would I be here? . I could tell it was going to end up in an argument so I just let it go after that.   How do I handle this situation? I want to bring it up with him but I don't know how to do it. I guess I'm not really good at articulating how I feel.   Or should I not say anything because this is just the way relationships go?  Please advise me because I'm a little lost.  Tl;Dr : My bf and I have dated for over ten years all together. He is going to propose soon but I'm not completely happy as I feel unloved. He's somewhat abrupt and not affectionate anymore and it's making me question whether things aren't ideal or whether it's a normal aging relationship.",1

Backstory, my best friend and I met a couple of years ago (about 11-12 yrs) and have been “inseparable” to say the least. She’s more on the “dominant” side (full lesbian) where I’m more feminine (bisexual) so we pretty much complimented each other very well. We used to live together and before that, we’d always flirt with each other, hang out all the time, just enjoying each other’s company. Living with each other is when things started getting “complicated”… we ended up “playing house” in a sense and slept together quite a few times. She even professed her love for me but became emotional saying she didn’t want the friendship to be over (which it wasn’t going to be bc I felt the same way about her) When she moved out, things became strained in a sense bc I felt a little distance on her end. We even talked about marriage and kids but she never perused me  Even after her moving, we still hung out, made out, slept together but she would always mention her being in a relationship with other ppl or dating other ppl (we kept clean bills of health fyi) so it kind of broke my heart. I moved on and she did too but we remained close.  Fast forward, we just got back being cool again and all of these feelings I had for her came back ten fold. I bit the bullet and told her I was in love with her in which she replied that she was shocked and didn’t know how to respond so now our convo has been again: distant. I know for a fact she still loves me and is in love but idk why she’s acting weird about it, let alone ignoring me. Could this be her processing her feelings still or her not wanting to fully commit?  TL/DR: I’m in love with my best friend and have been since we first met a decade ago but idk if she still feels the same. UPDATE: she responded that while she respects my honesty, she can’t respond how she used to anymore… I was yesterday years old when I found out she had gotten married.",1

We have been together 7 yrs & this is our first & only relationship. At the beginning of the relationship, he would behave rude to me in front of his relatives & family. I have been communicating this frequently & though there is some improvement, the problem still exists  My concern is that even after frequent communication he continues to behave rude to me, not supporting me in front of people & overstepping my boundaries. He makes  jokes  about me in front of close family & nobody finds it funny.  My partner really does care for me but the way he is going about a relationship is all wrong & my patience is running out  How do I communicate to my partner that he is being rude to me in front of other people?  TL;DR- Life partner does not know how to behave in a relationship  Final Update- I sat down with my life partner & discussed this issue. Many things came to light. For info- I haven't been a good partner at the beginning of the relationship. I believe both of us are verbally abusive. But that does not give anyone the excuse to be rude to me. I had my suspicions from the beginning that my relationship is toxic & your overwhelming response has confirmed it.    I went with the best intentions to save this relationship, but my life partner does not like me as a person, which is in turn causing his rude behaviour. In turn, I too believe that love is lost on both sides. I will instead focus on ensuring that nobody treats me badly    As heartbreaking as it is, there is no leaving this relationship as it's impractical & difficult to find a loving & respectful relationship where I come from. I come from SE Asia & these kinds of relationships are sadly considered normal & actually successful, but in reality, are toxic & loveless relationships that take a toll on you    Thank you, everyone, for your love & support.

Hello there, i hope you are all having an amazing day, if you are not, you are welcome to dm me at any time, id love to try and help!  Alright so heres the start, ive been dating for a long time now, a lot of relationships have gone down the drain   It has been a real struggle for me to be stable in a relationship without constantly worrying or overthinking because of many toxic relationships, and the fact that i have a ton of mental issues (depression, adhd, autism, trauma, trust issues, hypersexuality etc...) so i feel like im a bad partner.  Dont get me wrong, im a nice guy, as ironic as it is to say that, i do believe so, everytime me and my partner get intimite and its early in the relationship i ask if it is really okay, and that its completely fine to say no, after all i belive trust, honesty and loyalty are the most important things in a relationship. I want them to feel comfortable, i want them to tell me if something is wrong, or if im doing something wrong so i can act upon it and improve myself so i could make the situation more comfortable for them and thus more enjoyable to spend time with them.  Unfotunatly my kindness and caringness (right word? not sure, english is not my main language) has been the downfall of me many times, mostly becuase the girl i have been with played me, toyed with me, disnt care or cheated on me.  I am mostly oblivious to red flags, i always tend to think positivly like  oh she just spend souch time with her bestie because they grew up together  or  yea sure she hasnent messaged me in 4 hours beside saying she is free, but im sure something just came up, even tho they are activly playing a game at the moment   I often feel left out, i am genuinly considering not getting into a relationship again, previous relationships have messed me up so badly that when im genuinly in love, it fades away easily and i can move on like its nothing, i want to feel love again, but since i have been so many heartbreaks and bascicaly have become numb to anything negative in life, id be a bad partner now, i dont want to get into relationships because knowing my luck, and how quickly love fades for me, itll just be a disaster for my partner, but i so badly want to share my heart with someone, make someone feel wanted, share my kindness with someone and just see them smile at my actions, i want to be there for someone.  People always say the experiences make you stronger,and that is true, but i feel like i have been exposed to too many of those experiences that ive become numb to it.  An example is for example, in 2022 i was dating this girl, she broke up with her ex a few weeks before that, i wanted to make her feel loved again, she was everything i could have ever wanted, until 3 months ago. She got a call from her ex saying he misses her and want to get back together, she instantly text dumped me, i was playing a game at the time, i got the text, i stared at it for a few minutes while thinking, then just put down my phone and finished my game and went to be, no crying, no emotions, just  damn... that just my luck i guess  the next day she came to me crying that her ex was joking and she wants me back.  And me bing the stupid oblivious, forgiving guy that i am, i forgave her and we continued on, the relationship went down from there, she blamed everything on me, each time i brought it up she would brush it right off, neddless to say i cut contact with her 2 weeks after, saying we could still be friends, but that didnt work out either since we constantly argued.  Needless to say im a total wreck, emotionless, caring about nothing, tough as a rock but oblivious to everything  I just wanted to share my story, ive had far worse relationships to where this seems amateur. You are free to ask about anything, even those other stories, i will respond if i find time. Yes i will share almist anything since i could not care less.  I just want to know what do i do from here on? Do i quit relationships? Should i try to find the right girl? I just want to hear many opinions and arguments about this since this will have an impact on my life. Im just so lost.  Thanks in advance everyone, and im sorry if my english is at all bad or if i posted not enough information, my autism tends to summarise everything very very compactly.  tl;dr: i bascicaly feel nothing anymore and i wonder what i should do about my future if i can move on and care so little about such serious things as love.",1
Independent_Tip_5307,I (M22) have been in love with my best friend (F22) since high school.,3,13jrwkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13jrwkb/i_m22_have_been_in_love_with_my_best_friend_f22/,14,2023-05-17 04:57:20,relationships,"Let me start by saying we lost our virginity’s to each other. We were both very young, and wanted to get it over with. Weird as it may be. We had both decided it was for the best.  Things got very awkward between us before they got better. We both tried out different relationships later in high school. Eventually, senior year came around and we both had been cheated on. We had grown very close talking about each other’s dating life.   We had very much in common, and we knew exactly what each other liked, and what we did not like. You can say we taught each other. What was the perfect counterpart for a relationship male versus female.    Eventually, I had found myself in a position where it hit me. This woman that I am talking to. knows all of my likes dislikes. All my pet peeves, all my insecurities, and excepts them. I truly would not mind spending every day with her.   In my eyes, that’s one of the most important things in Deming, whether or not you love someone. Once I had figured this out, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I expressed my feelings. There was a bit of shock involved for her.   I’m not sure if I unintentionally made myself the “gay best friend “. Or if I was just that guy that she can talk too. But now my feelings were out there. She told me that she couldn’t see us being together right then, but possibly in the future.   I being the understanding guy that I am went with it and said take as long as you need. In my eyes, you only find that type of love may be a few times in the life.  After high school, I was working, trying to go to night school, struggling to keep up with my bills. Eventually, I decided to enlist in the military. This, had put a divide between us. She did not like the idea of me leaving. Though I can’t really blame her because I made the decision on my own.   And you never really expect anyone to wait four years for you while you’re in the military. Or put up with the long distance. Even though the decision has been made, and I have left. We still somehow made it work.  Every year I had come back during Christmas and we hung out the whole time. There was literally no when I talk to you more than her.   Eventually, she met a guy that she had found an interest in. She began to date this guy. All I could do was nod and wave. It crushed me. But I realize I had made my choice. I also told her I would wait and let her figure things out.  I promised myself that I would never be the guy that stopped her from being happy. We still talk regularly. Still kept to a normal schedule.  When her relationship with other guy ended, it was abrupt, and I caught her if she fell and crumbled. I’m not gonna lie. There was a part of me that was happy and then there was a part of me that was very upset. Later that same year I need to have surgery that was going to incapacitate me. For a couple months, so I got convalescent leave.   We spent the entire time together she was helping me get nursed back to Health. I only fell deeper in love with her. Before I left to go back, I essentially told her that I was done waiting that I wanted to be more official about it. Mind you this was essentially a four year ordeal.   I kept my end of the deal and waited for 4+ years. She was hesitant, but didn’t necessarily say no. Once I went back, I was ghosted. After all the countless hours that we spent on the phone, in person. I found it appalling that she could just ghost me after all that time. At the very least, I felt I was justified a response. Feelings change, commitments are hard, etc..   But I was there for her through all the other relationships. Being the cool friend, that I am talking her through all of her problems. Maybe I’m a fool for thinking that I could possibly work out. But I’d rather be a fool who tried, then a fool for not trying.   When she finally did reach back to me, she had seen me lost my cool for may be the second time ever, first time on her. I absolutely let her have it. I’ve never felt so led on. And disappointing. I feel every person is at the bare minimum deserving of an explanation. But she had none.   I had told her that I would always be in her corner, and only to contact me again if she had truly needed to talk to me. I told her I needed some space to think about the situation we were in. Even though she has been my rock in many situations thus far. I was so frustrated that I didn’t wanna keep taking it out on her directly. That is just not the type of guy I am.   My question is, was I wrong to blow my top and how could I have handled this better?     TL;DR My best friend (F22) and I (M22) got into a heated argument I had lost my cool and decided not to talk for a while was I in the wrong?",1
Alpacalypse_Llamarok,My [25M] friend sent me a screenshot of an active and verified Tinder profile of my boyfriend (23M),4463,14cpjai,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14cpjai/my_25m_friend_sent_me_a_screenshot_of_an_active/,582,2023-06-18 17:07:56,relationship_advice,"**This is my friend's story not mine. He asked for me to write this post because he does not know english. Read the story like if it was him writting.**   A friend of mine sent some screenshots of a tinder profile that had an Active badge (meaning profile was online in the past 2 hours), and it was verified.  The profile had a bunch of photos of my boyfriend and when I asked my him about that and he swore it's a fake profile saying it's not the first time finds a fake profile with his pictures, and he also said he deleted his Tinder account a long time ago.  I found out that the profile was last online 3 killometers away from his home which is quite far even for innacurate GPS.  Anyway, I found all of this weird because verified profiles require selfies with specific gestures. The profile also had a lot of his real hobbies and personality traits, his college course, his profession and etc. If the profile is really a fake one, it was created by someone who definitely knows him.  Things got a little worse I asked him to download tinder and login with his account. To me he would download it and show that he doesn't have an account, or if he did, it was innactive and that the other one was indeed a fake account. However he denied me this saying that relationships are based on trust and that I had to trust him, specially because it's not the first time that I suspect him and get proved wrong and he was tired of having to prove things.  Now I don't know what to do... I love him and I wanna trust him, but the profile was very convincing (many photos, perfect description and hobbies, verified). He could have spent just 5mins to show me his account and shut me up, but instead he came with that trust talk. The only thing he did was showing me that all the photos that the profile had were available on his instagram at some point, since last year, meaning someone could have used them.  Another behaviour that I found weird was the he didn't even bother about the verified fake profile using his photos. I mean, who doesn't get upset with this? I offered him to help find the fake profile and he didn't show any interest at all.  What would you do? Should I ignore this and blindly trust him?  **Update:**  The profile existed for at least 6 months, which is very hard achievement for a fake profile. I know this because a friend already chatted with that profile in january.  The funniest part is that right after I left my boyfriend at his home, the profile suddenly gets deleted.  What a coincidence right? A 6 months old fake profile being deleted at the exact same day I confronted my boyfriend about that. LOL  **Update 2:**  1. I broke up with him as this was the only option no matter how I tried to find a way to defend and forgive him. It hurts so much because I helped him with so many things, we spent all the time together and if he was trustworthy this relationship would have gone so far. If he was the person I thought he was, I would have married him. Now I am just alone, I have always been a lonely person with few friends. He was by far my best friend. 2. One of the reasons his trust talk may not be bullshit is because I already suspected him 2 or 3 times in the past months, and in one of them I demanded to read his Instagram DMs, but he refused after I started reading some of the messages. In another one I shamefully created a fake profile to test him... So he has been asking for trust for quite a while. On the other hand it's clear to me that my past suspicions and paranoia may not have been so crazy/paranoid like I have been acused of. Yes I have trust issues and I am going to a therapist, but at the same time I blindly loved him and even so I was never able to fully trust him no matter how hard I tried. I never had even 20% of this difficulty on trusting any of my ex boyfriends. 3. For those suggesting that the profile could be a fake created by my friend trying to make us break up, it isn't because the profile is more than 6 months old, but my relationship is 4 just months old. 4. None of my friends would be able to meet the profile person, because one of them didn't match. The other one is known by my boyfriend. The profile was deleted anyway. 5. Yes I will get tested for STDs in a few weeks or months. I already did a full checkup a month ago and it was clean (and even showed to my boyfriend), but yes I will get tested again for obvious reasons. 6. What infuriates me is that he didn't admit the profile was his. He trully thinks I am 100% fool. At this point I don't know if he was using me for some kind of financial advantage, or if he wanted me to be the  **guy to show to you friends**  while he had sex with many others. I will never know. 7. Yes my ex is good looking enough (specially his face) to have a fake account created (even though I find it very difficult for someone to pick him as target). He also said many times that he found some fake profiles of him on social media like instagram  Update 3:  The only possibility of it being a fake is if the fake is owned by one of his friends, and his friend deleted the profile right after my friend messaged the profile.

My mom was in the hospital for a month. Thankfully she made it but won't ever be the same. He was always the nice good guy. He definitely had trouble talking about feelings but to exhibit such cruel behavior at a time in need is just unfathomable. We knew eachother's families. I haven't told my family yet because they loved him. I'm trying to make sense of how someone could do this. Any thoughts on why someone would act like this in his mid 40s?  Any advice on getting past this?,1
Southern-Ice-9002,Friend [16F] is pretending to have a crush on me [17M] to get closer to my friend [M17] and i feel like a tool,66,146ne7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/146ne7d/friend_16f_is_pretending_to_have_a_crush_on_me/,98,2023-06-11 07:21:53,relationships,"         So im M17, high school student. I have a group of solid friends with majority of guys and some girls. To not be confusing i will put names (not real names) on my friends.   So there is Matt (17M). Matt is a really cool guy. Funny, nice, a bit cocky but not too much. He is really conventionally attractive like tall, handsome and athletic. I know him since beginning of high school and there was a lot of girls having a crush on him. I was jealous of him at first but since he was always nice with me eventually the jealousy disappeared. I am basically the opposite of Matt. Im not hideous but im clearly below average. Im short and fat. So girls dont pay attention to me. I get used to it and now it doesnt bother me, im okay being alone with my videogames and books. I have good friends and thats okay i dont need a girlfriend, even though it could be really cool to have someone loved you.  Then we will call my other friend Julie [16F). We met Julie this year with my other friends. She is a nice girl, a bit shy but thats okay. She gets along with the group. Of course she is flirting with Matt, and also others of my friends that are also good looking. But what i appreciate about her is that she never looked down to me because im not attractive like my others friends. She wss really nice to me and i thought she was a great friend. Until now.  One of my other friends, who is basically the girl best friend of Julie, come to me one day and says that Julie has a crush on me. I was shocked and i didnt know how to react as its the first time it is happening. My friend tell me to try getting closer to her. But something turns me off.  It isnt logical. Why would she prefer me over Matt? Like okay i know physical appearance isnt the end all be all, but Matt has a great personnality too and on top of that h e doesnt look like a gremlins like me lol. It makes no sense. She has 100 reasons to fall for Matt or even one of my others friends than me.  I thought about it and i think that since i am really close to Matt, she is using me to get closer to him. Thats my most probable theory. Im okay with her being attracted to him but i find it rude that she is basically using me like an item to get closer to him. Im not a fucking tool thats rude asf. I dont know what to do, because i am afraid i ruin my friend group if im acting rude towards Julie, but at the same time i dont want to be used, especially when she try to play with my feelings, telling me she is attracted to me whereas she is not. Im coming for advice because i dont know what to do in this case to not ruin a friendship.  tl;dr: a girl in my friend group pretend to have a crush on me whereas im ugly. I suspect that she is doing it to getting closer to my friend Matt who is very attractive and i find it rude to use me like a tool but i dont know what to do",1

I really love them and appreciate that they’re letting me live here essentially for free whilst I complete my PhD.   The trouble is I find that as I’m getting further into (young) adulthood I’m developing my own routine and sense of direction which makes living with my parents uncomfortable at best. I prefer to have my own space and time especially because my PhD is so demanding sometimes I just want silent time.   This often causes fights because “I never make time for them” even though every weekend we go somewhere or do something together. It’s just through the week I need my own space to work and relax after.   Problems started recently because I’m starting to look at maybe moving out and I feel less and less welcome in my own home. I feel like whatever mood my parents are in also influences how I feel like I’m walking on eggshells in case they yell at me. I do all my Own chores btw.   Tl;dr I just feel like it’s time to move out for my mental health but my city is so expensive. How can I make living at home more bearable?,1

He was super excited about the mower and I gave him my opinion which was I didn’t think it was a good financial decision and now he is super bummed out and I feel bad. …Then unfortunately I poured salt in the wound asking if he could find money for a mower is his reason for waiting on marriage really a good excuse?

We went to Montenegro for four nights/five days. The holiday was okay throughout, but on the fourth day, my boyfriend was adamant on climbing a mountain.   We had been walking a lot, almost 13+ miles a day, and I was feeling knackered. I also wanted to take it slow as I was on my period and I often have heavy flows and painful cramps. We were on the local bus, and I asked him if we could go to the nearest town and stay there for a few hours first and then walk the mountain afterwards and then he got upset and said that I was making it about myself and that I was using my period as an excuse. I tried to explain that I wasn’t refusing to climb, I just wanted to take it easy.   However I caved in and got off earlier to walk to the mountain. He kept walking off really fast when I would ask him to wait up for me, and I understand it’s annoying having to wait for someone who walks the speed of a snail but it led into an argument and he walked off. I sat down for a bit and I saw him still walking until he disappeared from view. I didn’t want to stay there alone because the roads were deserted and it was a very quiet day.   Even though Montenegro is known to be relatively safe, I was still in a place where I couldn’t speak the language and there was poor phone signal and I didn’t have international data. I ended up walking two hours, following a road becoming more and more hysterical and upset because he wasn’t anywhere to be seen. I called out his name several times and there was nothing.   Luckily I bumped into a couple who called my boyfriend on my behalf and he said he would come down. Then when he came down he said that I left him and that I was asking for it etc.  After some heated exchange, he then admitted that he only said it because he was angry and embarrassed and didn’t want to own up that he was wrong. He said he wouldn’t do it again because his actions came out of a place of anger. As well, he said he was already coming back down because he didn’t want to leave me behind. I told him he needed to see a therapist.   To be honest, I just want someone to tell me I haven’t lost my sanity, and what the best steps forward is. I have been with him for two years, and we love each other very much. And I know the classic trope where you don’t see what’s in front of you but others can, and I’m just wondering if it was a honest mistake (fucked up one) or if it’s something worse?",1

Posting this wherever will take it being such a new account, but my username describes how I currently feel, it's like love is no longer a thing, people just want flings. My last relationship proved in hindsight to be a total betrayal, long story, so the last time I was with anyone that actually cared was around 2018, after my first ever gf at 22 in 2017, who didn't want anything serious, but now she's literally getting married in 2 weeks, and not to me, I'm 28, have absolutely no friends, was born with autism and the most severe shyness that a person can possibly have, so I need Valium, doctor recommended, to even be able talk to people, it works somewhat, but it dumbs me down and makes me less talkative, but more open, I become a good listener over anything and end up being people's emotional tampons. If I'm not on the stuff good luck getting through to me, it's borderline selective mutism, and has affected me since I became sentient. I honestly don't know what to do, I've known therapy was a step early on and started at 17 in high school, still go regularly, but it doesn't really help me with those specific issues, making friends, building a social circle, finding love most of all, I am beyond lonely, if I were to describe it, I feel like a 3000 year old mountain hermit that's been out of contact with humans for a good 98% of it, and I'm socially inept, and can't find anyone willing to act as a mentor or teacher in that regard, all online scam crap, but if it is legit I make good money, analytically gifted as all he'll, just had to sacrifice the social part of my brain to learn all this tech stuff. Let me know what I should do, I am directionless, no coin to flip, don't even have 2 sides picked out. I'm also starting to think I'm simply repulsive because I'm getting older and at 28 it kinda feels weird hitting on a younger 20something,  I feel extremely old for a 28 year old no joke, please help 🙏",1

At the very beginning he told me he had liked me but I rejected him and said that we could be friends. I made it very clear from the start that I did not like him back and that i never wanted to lead him on or anything like that. And he accepted that. Over the course of a year and actually becoming closer friends he said he was in love with me and that he couldn't understand why I didn't love him back. I explained that it wasn't him and that I simply wasn't looking for a relationship and have never actually been in love before meaning I wasn't ready for that. But I do still love and care about him just not in a romantic way.    Throughout the remaining years of us being friends he has had trouble excepting that. It became really hard for him to see me as a friend because he  loved me so much . To the point where we've had to take breaks from talking to each other because the stress began to affect me aswell. At one point he did end up dating someone but eventually realized that the girl wasn't me and he was basically using her as a distraction. As we continued to be friends we kinda came to the conclusion that distance and us not keeping in contact with each other as often( we would text every single day) would help both of us. But he said that he just couldn't do that and that it would hurt too much. Even though us being close friends is the main reason he is hurting.   After some time and consideration I've come to the conclusion that I can't just say we need space or a break, rather it has to be a complete separation. The only hard part is how do I do that without hurting him or myself in the process? I don't want to just ghost him but I also can't keep dragging this on. Any advice?  TL;DR! My best friend is hurting because he is in love with me and I don't love him back. Which has now caused issues for the both of us.

He called me this morning to give me the rundown:      She had her birthday this past Monday, so their friends all got together for a weekend of partying. My best friend said it was the same as all of the last 10 birthdays - lots of drinking and a major hangover. Nothing out of the ordinary. Then on Monday night after everyone went home, she came to him and said she wanted to stop drinking (a massive step for them!). She came clean and revealed she was hiding how much she actually drank on a daily basis (8-10 beers outside of what he already knew, and that's at a minimum), showing him where she hid her stashes of beer and spirits. He was relieved she came clean to him, and promised her he would help her in any way she needed.      She was fine on Tuesday and Wednesday (MY guess is she had a sip or two of something to taper down), but on Thursday night she had a seizure and had to be rushed to the hospital. She is stable and sedated now, and my friend finally called me and told me all of this a few minutes ago.

To ride the waters of a body  is to sail around the world, navigating  a windrose without a compass.  Islands, gulfs, peninsulas, breakwaters—  it’s not an easy task, though pleasurable—  don’t think you can do it all in one day  or in one night filled with splayed sheets.  There are enough secrets in our pores  to fill many moons.  &#x200B;  II.  The body is an astrology chart  written in an encrypted language.  You find a star, and then, perhaps,  begin to correct your course,  when a storm cloud  or a moan most profound  makes you tremble.  You did not suspect that you would be  in the hollow of this hand.  &#x200B;  III.  Go over a certain spot again and again.  Find the water lilied lake  and anchor your caress in its center.  Submerge yourself, sink yourself, stretch out.  Do not deny yourself the smell, the salt, the sugar.  The deep winds—the cumulus nimbus in your lungs—  have clouded your mind. The tremor of legs,  the lulling tidal wave of kisses.  &#x200B;  IV.  Sink into soil. There’s no fear  of wearing out, no hurry.  Don’t reach the peak just yet.  Delay the gates of paradise.  Cradle your fallen angel.  Tousle their thick mane,  wield the flaming sword that you stole.  Bite the apple.  &#x200B;  V.  Inhale. Ache.  Exchange looks. Exchange saliva.  Cause your own pregnancy.  Circle the imprints in the skin that you made.  Find the foot at the end of the leg.  Search for the secret step formed by the heel.  The arch of your step, bays formed by arched walking.  Enjoy them.  &#x200B;  VI.  Listen to the conch of an ear,  how wetness seems to moan.  Earlobe approaches lip—the sound of breathing,  pores rising as they form tiny mountains.  Skin trembles from the rebellion of touch,  as the bridge of your neck  descends to the sea of your chest.

darksoulmakehappy,My gf (34f) and her roommate (32f) is moving in next week and I(32m) think her roommate is in love with her and is manipulative.,1,14hvxke,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14hvxke/my_gf_34f_and_her_roommate_32f_is_moving_in_next/,5,2023-06-24 15:34:35,relationship_advice,"So me and my girlfriend met a year and a half  ago. We are both taking the next step in the relationship and moving in together, and we are also moving to be in a different state to be closer to her family and because I have a new job.   A little bit of background she has lived with her roommate for the past ten years. She's told me that when she first moved in, her roommate became obsessed with her and started dressing the same way as her, and if she bought something, her roommate would go out and buy the same thing.   What I've noticed about her roommate is that she always agrees with whatever my gf says and always likes the same things that she likes. Every time I'm there, her roommate is super quiet and is just kind of sitting there and has no personality.  Her roommate has not had a relationship for the past ten years they have lived together. When they started living together, she told my gf she had a crush on her, but my gf told her she is not into girls.   I've always been nice to her friend and ive told my gf that she should stop being mean to her but when we started dating her friend told her she shouldn't date me because she is moving too soon from her last relationship (that was 6m prior to us meeting and only lasted 3m.) and that she just wants her to be happy and that she loves her.   Every time they argue , she is frequently her friend sends her a crazy amount of text, saying that she loves her and that she can't live without her. When they argue, her friend will start buying her expensive gifts and shower her with love messages. She also always seems to do stuff to make her happy.  On her birthday, which was two months ago, her friend spent almost $1200 on her. Then they started arguing the next day because she felt her friend was smothering her and not giving her breathing space.  When my gf told her she was moving out, a massive argument broke out that lasted almost two weeks. I didn't see the fight personally, but my gf told me it was very toxic and there was a lot of yelling and screaming. My gf told me she thinks her roommate is in love with her.   My gf sent me text messages from her roommate. One of them said  Why won't you wait for me, I feel like I will kill myself by august it just fucks with your head having someone hate you so much .  Next thing I know they made peace with each other and her roommate is now coming to live with us. I did say she can have her friend live with us but during there massive argument I made it clear I no longer wanted her living with us.  And her friend who has done nothing but try to sabatoge things between us is now saying that she has a lot of respect for me and she is happy for us.  My gf thinks that this is her best friend who is just very insecure and has no other friends, I think that she is crazy and manipulative and secretly wants to live with her for the rest of her life and other people who have seen the situation from the outside have thought that she is in a relationship with her. I also can't believe someone who I don't want living in my house and I've made it pretty clear to her is just going to move into my house.  Is it just me, or is there really something wrong with this picture? Somehow, I think all this showering with love is actually abusive.",1

I am a 36 year-old woman who is in a very complicated situation. I don't want to get into details here, but I am considering a divorce. One thing that's keeping me back is that I really have a lot of love to give to the right person, but I'm afraid finding someone would be difficult at my age and I truly don't want to spend the rest of my life alone.   So this is why I'd love to hear from those of you who have found love after divorce or later in life (i.e. after the age of 35-40). I don't just mean a partner or a friend with benefits or whatever. I mean someone whom you would describe as a soulmate or the love of your life.   I would be honored to hear your stories!",1

She really makes me confident, happy, feel loved for just the way I am, and I try to do my best to do the same for her.   The big problem is our families. My mum wants a girl that is religious or believes in the muslim God.   Her family wants a guy for her that's from the same caste, obviously same religion, lives nearby their place and earns well.  Then, the state of the country's mindset on muslims. Any case with a muslim named person doing any wrong is getting ultra-flashy breaking news with his name highlighted the most, creating the impression that every muslim named person will just trap you and kill you. Many of her friends told her to stay away from me too.   Too many people are afraid now, including her family.   What if we go against all and get married anyway? Well, first of all, she loses her family. They won't even touch her, won't ever eat what she made, and if anything bad happens in our relationship, or if we don't work out, she is left all alone with nothing.  So called 'unconditional love' they say.   The situation is really bad.   I just really don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to ruin her life. She means so much to me. I've never felt better with someone in my life. But I won't let my feelings be selfish and make the wrong choice.  Any advice or ideas are appreciated. Thank you.",1

Last Friday she told me she wanted to take a break and just think about our future, Saturday comes and she tells me she's going out with her best friend.  I've known her best friend for a while. She's a cool woman. Anyway, they end up going to a club while I'm away with family. A few days later, my girlfriend told me she slept with this random dude she just met at the club. I later found out it was a man her best friend set her up with...  I got pissed off, I told her she cheated on me, and she kept saying she didn't since we took a break. Why would she fuck someone else after telling me she loves me and just needs time to think?  I've been thinking about this all week, I feel betrayed and hurt. I've known this woman since I was 17. I'm kind of tempted to just leave her, but at the same time I've grown attached to her son from a previous relationship.   I'm not sure how to move on from here.     Update: Sorry for the lack of replies on my part! My brother and I share reddit accounts, and I forgot we had notifications off.  Anyway, I have decided to talk to her once she returns from work. She usually stays an extra hour or two. She works in the medical field. Will update once I've spoken to her. I am kind of nervous tho, I hope I can keep calm and hopefully not break down.    Update 2: she came home, and I confronted her right away. I want to say I stayed strong, but I did cry a bit, but I told her I considered it cheating. As soon as I said that, she started crying and surprisingly tried to hit me. No, she's never done anything like that before. She's also called her BFF over here, and she's on her way. I've locked myself in our room. I don't really know if I should leave from the window or something.   Final update: I ended up calling her mother to come get her. The best friend arrived and tried doing what I expected her to do and tried to lie to me. I'm with my parents now. My mom is in the hospital because of some other unrelated issues. My dad is gonna go back to the house and grab my stuff from there.    I don't feel like I've got the mental strength to deal with the ex right now. I'm just gonna focus on my mother and figure it out from there. I do know that I'm not going back with her, tho. Thanks to everyone who helped and gave me advice. Love yall.",1

We immediately become close friends and openly discuss how much we care for each other, share music, talk about our emotions, hug... anyways we're dating now. We've been daying for a soon to be 8 months, and we've been a perfect lil couple.  We have a similar sense of humor, both of us have been to therapy and we communicate well, I engage with his clubs/work (he's an engineer), we make a point to make time for each other and it's all so nice. We had one shakey moment and it was before we started to really schedule  go to your house and cuddle and be lame little nerds.  That was 3 months ago, but this man has made me so incredibly happy and I never thought it'd be this good with anyone  Point is, he feels too good to be true, and we both are terrified by how much we like and love each other. His mom cracked a joke about me and his brother's girlfriend being daughter in laws. They want me to go with them to their family cabin. We had a long talk about how important we are to each other, and he has told me directly that he wants to live with me one day and struggles to see what his future would look like without me in it. It makes me feel happy, but also so incredibly spooked over how much we just work. We've both had other relationships but this one in all stages has felt so incredibly different.  This all started because his mom was showing me his baby photos. We were cuddling, and since I did not want to fall asleep I asked him to tell me all the sappy shit he thinks about us. It was a lot. I know it takes 18 to 24 months to have the rose tinted glasses fade away. I know he's a workaholic, busy most of the time, and snores. I know he's the type to bottle his anger, but I also know that he'll talk to me about it before it gets bad. We've already done that. He knows I'm snarky, quicker to anger as well as a mean angry girl when I hit that point. He knows I'm forgetful, but also knows I work to overcome most of my flaws.   I love him so much. We tell each other that often and with meaning. I write poetry. He makes me little things. He knows me, and more importantly he's one of my best friends I've ever had. And that scares me.  TL;DR! My boyfriend is my best friend and the thought of him not being in my life frightens me. We're comfortable in silence, we are active in each other's work, my parents like him and it feels too good.

We spend as much time as possible with each other and always support and trust one another's decisions. We have been planning to move in together so we can start living as a real couple.  Recently I was offered a job I could not pass up but involves me moving to another state. I want her to come as I believe she will have a blast there and this would be a good fresh start for us as a couple. However, she doesn't want to go.  She has just recently started living alone and has only experienced life alone for a year. All her friends moved away and all her family did too. Besides work and her apartment, she has no roots keeping her down in her home area. I want to bring her with me so we can be together and do all the fun things we've talked about doing in this bigger and opportunistic town. She agrees she would probably have fun but is hesitant to come with me.  When I applied for the work and told her about the move she also said she would move with me so I am somewhat hurt that she wasn't happy and ready to pickup her life for me as we have a close tight knit bond and do everything together. And she promised me we would be with one another forever so I feel like its just her nerves and she'll get over it. That said she does have some reservations she has discussed with me.  The place we are going is hotter than home and has less greenery than she would like but I have assured her that it is all something we can get used to and there are many areas with forests and greenery within reasonable driving distance. She also says she doesn't want to spend so much money moving, which shouldn't be a problem given she'll need to sell most of her furniture anyways as those cannot come with us. Though she does need to break her lease and that is apparently quite expensive. She may be in a slight debt for a short while though she told me she has some savings she can use so that shouldn't be an issue either.  Moving myself has already been expensive for me so I can only help a little financially. But I have assured her that I will cover the cost of rent the first few months while she looks for work and settles in our new home. After that, she agreed to split the rent evenly as we believe most couples do. While I know it sounds cruel that I am not paying for her move, we are a team and I promise to take care of her once she gets down there.  I believe this move to be the best option for us and I am so happy I convinced her to come. It will be a change of scenery for the both of us but I genuinely believe she will love it there as much as I will. This job is important to me and a major pay raise so we should be alright financially especially since she intends to work as well. I know she still does not really wish to go and she is worried this could be a mistake, but I believe we should at least try so we can finally be together and live as we've always wanted to.  Do any of you have other ways I could convince and assure my girlfriend coming is the right choice?  Tl;dr: I convinced my girlfriend to move with me so we can finally be together the way we always dreamed of despite her reservations about going.  &#x200B;  EDIT: I want to thank you all for your support and comments. They were much needed and I myself am quite surprised at some of the things said, though not in a bad way. Now as a little heads up and confession, I am not the one moving for a new job. She is. She is not the one hesitant about leaving. I am. Besides that, every word has been the truth as I have experienced it. I've posted about this before but I wanted a different perspective, technically from her perspective IF she ever posted here, which she never would. I am now in the process of deciding as I am a fool in love and I have no doubt that not going, will break us up. Again, thank you for you posts, they were very insightful. ",1

There have been ongoing issues with my husband and his coworker. At one point after a work party he got drunk and was texting her that “she should have made a move on him” while they were there, amongst other overly flirty/suggestive texts. This happened over a year ago now. He apologized and said it was “just a stupid joke”  When we got married he originally wanted to invite all his coworkers to our wedding celebration, but I said I wasn’t comfortable with his coworker going, he said he didn’t want to hurt her feelings, and thus did not invite any of his coworkers at all to spare her feelings.  He claims they are just friends, always.   Well today he’s giving her a ride an hour and a half both ways to go to a different location for work. He never dresses up, he barely shaves, he wears sweat pants to work. But yesterday he shaved, he put on some nice jeans, looked much nicer than usual. I pointed this out to him, he said it’s because he’s going to a different office and wants to look “professional” he told me I was overreacting to nothing as per usual.   Next week just the two of them are going on an overnight work trip in a different city, again sharing a car an hour and a half each way. I asked if I could join and just wait at the hotel while he’s working, he said no, that he can’t change the booking and it’s for work not appropriate etc.   He says that there is nothing going on between them, but it’s hard to believe that.   Can someone be my voice of reason here please? Am I overreacting?   Have any of you been through this with your partner/spouse? What happened? How was the situation handled?   Thank you for taking the time to read, and for any advice or words for thought   ****UPDATE 1****  Well it all kicked off, in a catastrophic way last night. I was messaging him while he was at work with her and telling him flat out I think he’s going to have an affair and I want a divorce. I asked if he was telling her what I was saying, he said yes. I told him it’s not right that he’s talking to her about our personal issues and he should be talking to me about them.  I told him I want $1,500 that he owes me for a payment on something we both agreed to split. He is refusing saying he does not owe me that, but he does. He came home, I asked him to send me that money and I will leave. He said no it’s for a house deposit. I told him no we are getting divorced. His parents got involved and it did not go well at all.   I slept in the guest room, he did not check on me. He sent me a single text this morning saying how he knows could have done more for the relationship and should have paid more attention to me. That he loves me so much and just because he talks to another female doesn’t mean he loves them. He said that married the woman he loves but she can’t see it most of the time.   I didn’t respond. I’m still in the guest room. I won’t lie I want him to come and talk to me, to try and fight for me, but I don’t think he cares anymore.   He still hasn’t sent me the money despite telling his parents he would.   He has still not sent any proof of hotel or a work trip.   I am at a total loss and completely heart broken. I don’t want a divorce, I just want the dubious behaviors to stop.   Thank you everyone for your advice and stories, and those who went through what I am right now, I’m so sorry and I hope you are all doing better now.   Yes I do struggle with insecurities. Sometimes I do think he manipulates and gas lights me. I’m not perfect either.   I don’t know where to go from here. I would like him to talk to me when he gets home, but I will be hiding in the spare bedroom. If he wants to see his wife he knows where I’m at. But I just don’t think he will even try and it shatters me, I’m a complete and total mess",1

I asked him if he was unsure of our bond and relationship potential. He did not answer which to me is an answer.  I am really sad and haven't been able to get an answer from him, but I think he isn't head over heels for me and isn't sure about us, even if he wants it to go on. Could he be cheating?

I am a law student. To show me what being a lawyer is like in practice, my mom, who is also a lawyer, took me to the firm where she works and introduced me to her colleague  A,  who is currently dealing with the subjects I'm studying. Over the past few months, I have started spending more and more time at my mom's workplace and hanging out with  A.  Initially, we talked about law and studies, and later we discussed personal topics.  A  is divorced and about 20 years older than me, with children of his own, and his ex-wife lives with them in another state.  Getting to the point... I have fallen in love with  A,  and our relationship is currently unclear. He once invited me to a concert where it was just the two of us. He was a true gentleman, picked me up, drove me home, and the whole outing felt like a date. Then he didn't contact me for a while until I showed up at his workplace again. And it was wonderful once more. We went to the theater together another time, but this time with my mom. A few days ago, I visited him at work again, and we talked about our personal matters, including our love lives. This time,  A  clearly flirted with me. He noticed the color of my eyes, complimented my intelligence, and laughed at jokes. After work, he suggested taking a walk to his house, where we spent some time before he drove me home. Yesterday, he proposed that we go to another concert, this time with my mom. I feel like I'm living in a triangle with my own mom. I can't decipher  A  and his intentions. There are moments when I see him flirting with me, looking at me, trying to find a way to touch me. Then he disappears and doesn't contact me until I come to his workplace again. My mom is furious with me for having feelings for  A.  She believes he is too old for me and carries too much emotional and life baggage (he had a hard time dealing with his divorce). I don't want to spend time with him only at work because people will start gossiping about  A  not doing his job and spending hours talking to a woman. I don't want him to have problems because of this. I don't know what to do because the situation overwhelms me, and I constantly feel sad and misunderstood by my loved ones.

Didn't end up working out and we broke up. There was this another girl I loved and she knew I loved her but she friendzoned me but I loved her so I couldn't back off, stayed in the friendzone and helped her in every way possible, a year and a half later she said that she didn't need me anymore cuz she's dating a guy and that just ended it for me. A month ago I met this girl in class, she was new and we kind of felt good in each other's company, a week later we started dating, she lives close to me like 10 minutes walk maximum she has kind of chill parents. I'mma be honest, this is the happiest I've ever been like we meet every day, we spend time together, we comfort each other and it's just I can't explain it in words but this is so good, she is just so good and I love her so much and she does too, I had never experienced physical form of love and it feels so good the way she randomly hugs me and  says how much she loves, just feel so unreal, I am so grateful to God for her and thankful to whoever reading this that u took ur time to read this.   Edit: I had my first kiss today with her and it was something out of this world, something I can't explain, it was first time for both of us so we weren't sure what exactly to do so we finished once and went for it again and we did a bit better but I guess after all its about us and we feel great, I've never been happier.

I moved to a new city almost 6 months ago. A few months before I moved I met my now long distance boyfriend. My last relationship was 3 years prior so I’m so excited to have met someone new. I had just graduated university and a year later I finally got a good job offer out of state and that’s why I moved. But I’m not crazy about the city, I’ve had weird experiences and I miss my cat and my boyfriend. But I feel like I don’t have any job opportunities back home that will grant me independence, pays my bills and gives me freedom to save and spend. I’ve applied and nothing. I’m scared to give up my independence to throw a shot into the dark at love. I’d be living at my parents again which I don’t mind but I feel like I’m ready to be on my own. I’d have to search for a new job that I might never find. I’d have to buy a new car. But I’m just not happy in the new city. I have no friends and my sister that got me the job is highly critical of me. If i can at least be working towards something I’ll be happy but I don’t like my current job, and don’t even know what I want my future to be and if I’ll ever get it but at least for the time being Im getting paid. Men at any time can get up and decide they don’t love you, and then what will I do? What would you do?",1

I don't quite know how to deal with this situation.  I've (24F) known Oliver (24M) since we were 13 when we became friends and shortly after started dating. I've known Amy (24F) for almost just as long.  Background on Oliver: Oliver and I dated for about 8 years. As we grew up together, our lives intertwined and most of our friend groups merged. We had plans to get married and have kids once we were financially independent. I saw myself spending the rest of my life with this man, we moved country together. But unfortunately our relationship wasn't perfect and we didn't make it to the financially independent stage. He broke up with me 2 years ago for very complicated reasons but to summarize: we both were in poor mental health and trying to prop each other up somewhat unsuccessfully, the sex life had died and no amount of therapy was fixing the relationship. I was hesitant to break up and figured we could work through it but knew deep down we both needed it and if we wanted a relationship in the future this break up had to happen. We said we'd stay friends but focus on ourselves. We also said that getting back together in the future was a possibility but not a guarantee. And we both did actually really need the break up. While it has been rocky, our mental health overall improved and we made progress towards our own careers. The first year of the breakup we took much needed space. I regrettably slept around a bit and when he found out he was hurt but we were able to maintain some sort of a friendship. Then sometime last year, we found ourselves in the same city again and tested the waters of getting back together. In January, after a lot of back a forth, a bit of a fwb situation, I called it quits because he had hesitations and I wanted full commitment and if he couldn't give me that I'd rather stay friends. I would consider him a close friend now.  Background on Amy: We met in school and while we've always had closer friends, we've stuck by each other and stayed really good friends over the years. There not much we don't talk about and while she doesn't know the intimate details of Oliver and I's relationship, she knows we were considering getting back together last year. Over the years, Oliver and Amy never seemed to be interested in each other as  they were rarely enthusiastic about seeing each other. Nonetheless they were friendly but never really tried to get to know each other. I was actually fine with this because I felt I could freely rant to Amy about the breakup as I knew it wasn't going to affect their friendship since they had none. They 100% did not do anything behind my back during the relationship and all of our mutual friends agree with me on this point so don't bother going down that avenue.  2 weeks ago: Amy tells me that she and Oliver kissed on a night out and had been on a few dates since. I was a bit shocked as I was not expecting it at all. I knew Oliver was on dating sites and I would have to eventually accept the fact that he would find someone else but wasn't expecting it to be my friend. Oliver and Amy themselves were quite shocked by the pairing too and are still in the stages of figuring out their own feelings. Amy was worried by my reaction and I originally didn't feel too strongly about it so I assured her that I was cool with it. I did admit it was a little weird and would take getting used to but I said that ultimately, it's none of my business and they shouldn't worry about what I thought. I said similar things to Oliver too when he later asked me how I felt.  But since then, I've sat with it and a couple of feelings have arisen. I think I'm still in love with Oliver. I know I shouldn't be surprised by this, especially since I was actually very eager to get back together with him, it was my self respect that made me break off the fwb situation. (Not bad-mouthing people who do fwb, but I was in love and sleeping with a dude who didn't love me back, I deserved more respect for myself than that).  And while I did try to get over him in the recent months, seeing him and Amy get together made me realise that I was not actually over him.  I don't know what do to with this though. They seem to like each other and I really want to be happy for them but I'm hurt by the reality that the guy I love isn't interested in me and no amount of  working on ourselves  is gonna be enough to get us back together. It's a reality I can no longer ignore or try to deny. There's not much I can actually do though, I care too much about Amy and Oliver as friends to push them away for this and they very much hope to stay friends with me too so I have to deal with these emotions myself. There is a possibility that they wont even get to a serious dating stage and I still might have a chance with Oliver but he might never like me back and anyways it's undeniably weird to date someone your close friend has been intimate with. It must be weird for Amy because I know absolutely everything about Oliver, his worse fears and anxieties, his hobbies, embarrassing childhood stories, his family history, how he likes his food, and more. She doesn't seem too weirded out by this but we also haven't talked too in depth about it so I could be wrong. I fear if we dive deep we will find something too awkward to talk about. It also feels wrong to even picture me and Oliver together because it's not fair on Amy.  Our mutual friends aren't too keen on them being together, many of them see it as bad friend behaviour which is fair but I can't really fault them. The heart wants what the heart wants and I don't really like setting restrictions on my friends. Neither Amy, Oliver, or any of our friends know that I'm still in love with Oliver, I've acted quite coolly about it around everyone because I don't want to cause drama. As far as anyone thinks, I'm totally over him and fine with them dating. That's why I'm here, in hopes I can get advice on how to deal with this quietly. My confession would reek havoc among our friends could ruin whatever Amy and Oliver have and I'll never forgive myself for that. I'd like to say I'd like advice on how to get over Oliver but I still really selfishly want him for myself and don't see how to overcome that. It would also be quite devastating for me to loose Oliver as a friend, even if more space between us is needed and I'm sure loads of you are going to suggest that, I would find it very difficult.  How to I get through this with my heart and friendships still intact?  TLDR; My ex and I broke up 2 years ago, considered getting back together last year but didn't. We stayed close friends though. Recently, he and my friend kissed and are going on a few dates with each other. I think I'm still in love with my ex and don't know how to deal with it.",1

It was a great lunch, I had a phenomenal paella! I wore a super cute pair of slingback heeled sandals. I assumed that after lunch we'd just be heading back home, but my boyfriend's parents suggested we take a walk through the park back to my boyfriend's apartment. I agreed because I didn't want to ruin the plan, which in retrospect was a terrible idea.   The walk was about 45 minutes. As cute as my shoes were, they were not made for walking and I could feel the blisters setting in after about 15 minutes of walking down an unpaved dirt hill.    My boyfriend noticed how much pain I was in and insisted I take his sneakers. So my germaphobe boyfriend walked in his socks all the way through the park and then on the filthy city street just so I could be more comfortable until we got home.

We met in at church about 4 years ago (yes I know the age gap sounds bad). We barely talked the first few times we saw each other. Then one of by best friends (who is now happily married) prank texted me through this girls phone.   We talked for a little bit before deciding we could try dating for a bit. Now at the time I was a little naive. And by a little I mean straight up stupid and didn’t know how to handle a relationship. It was the first one I had been in since I was 13 and I was happy but at the same time I was prone to making dumb mistakes. One night I texted a friend and asked to hook up with her, clearly wrong and a stupid decision and my girl (let’s call her Liz) found out. Liz was heartbroken that I’d do something like that. I said I was sorry and begged her to forgive me and not only did she forgive me, she stayed. I was surprised but beyond happy. Before I go on, I should mention she was an absolute 10. Short blonde who was exactly my type.   Before you say it, I don’t know why I did what I did. But it happened again a month later. It was only texting but text cheating is still cheating. This time I was drinking beforehand and she was a little more understanding. She forgave me again (mind you I didn’t deserve it). From then on I cleaned up, went to college for my dream job.   Now at the time we were already long distance and the pandemic only made things more difficult. And living in Canada we were routinely locked down and had to rely on gaming and FaceTime to hold things together. But we weren’t just holding things together. We were getting stronger. We had started talking about the future and I met her parents and some of her extended family and she met some of mine. It felt perfect. I went to college in Toronto, and to shrink the distance between us she was talking about going to a school a 15 minute walk away from my school. It was perfect.  Until one day she told me she had decided to go to a different school. This school was four hours away, and I didn’t realize it at the time but that was the beginning of the end. I was supportive of the move because it was what she wanted, but I knew it would be a lot harder on us.  She moved there in the fall of 2021. I visited her once in September, but at that point she was becoming more distant. I spent a weekend down there, and we fought a couple times. It was the first time we’d really ever fought about anything. I tried to hold on for all I could but it was slipping away.  Then on Canadian thanksgiving, she told me she needed time. I had read somewhere that when a girl says that, she really just wants to leave. And I reacted with no you can’t leave. I’m the end I think that was the last straw. I keep wondering if I had let her have time if she would have come back.  In the end, she said she hadn’t been able to mentally get over me cheating in the beginning, and was worried I was cheating again. I wasn’t this time, and had actually (before she had gone to school) been considering proposing to her. But her reasoning was valid in the end. I was a terrible bf in the beginning and that ruined any chance I had with her.   It’s been a year and about 8 months now. I went on maybe one or two dates since but no one ever felt right. And that’s the story of how I blew it with the girl of my dreams. And before you say anything. I know cheating is bad. I wish I had realized it before I made the same mistake twice.  Our relationship lasted two years. Would you have left after the first time? And do you think long distance works?  TL;DR: I cheated on my girlfriend twice in the beginning of our relationship. She forgave me both times and we had a happy relationship for another year and a half. Then she went away to school and broke up with me because she was scared I would cheat again.",1

We now feel as if we are at the crossroads of our relationship.   Every couple has disparity in expectations, especially in their first serious relationships and ours has been no different. We’ve had fights, moreso debates around every three months or so, and this happens to be our third tough discussion. 1 and 2 were over intimacy and how comfortable she felt during intimate moments with me. She a rough first situationship 4 years ago and she carries the weight of that uncomfortableness and trauma to this day, and we’ve worked through this seemingly well after some comments about her not trying hard enough.  We’ve accepted my drive is just greater than hers.   During our 8th month of dating, I told her some rough yet honest things about her appearance after we finished playing a game with friends, and I tried to phrase it in a constructive/honest way, but failed miserably. Nobody likes to be commented on their appearance in any negative way, especially when that is a big insecurity and I apologized and made up in anyways I could. No doubt, I told her that I find her beautiful in every way but said  others found her pretty in a unique way. I’ll carry the weight of that pain I saw on her face everytime we discuss this night, gosh I love this girl and can’t believe I’ve caused her such deep pain.   We’re now doing medium distance (60-90 minutes apart) and things are not going as planned. We both love each other very much but her communication style is to stay present and not rooted to her phone (I get 1round of multiple texts a day) and I always want to know what’s going on with her and how she’s doing. This has always been a disconnect between us and weve gotten much better at meeting in the middle of our styles in a healthy way over the months, but she’s been extra distant these past 3 weeks of mid-distance.   I brought these frustrations to her in a  negative way when I can’t handle my emotions with all my alone time and it caused some thinking on her part about why she’s been extra distant. She realized she doesn’t feel 100% comfortable with me after hurting her soft spots months ago so it’s harder for her to truly WANT to meet in the middle, now that we’re further apart.   We’ve been able to bridge issues with patience, communication, and the natural love in our relationship but this time feels different. She’s not wanting to change as much and I’m struggling in a new place while needing support that she can’t give right now. Is this the end of us if she can’t heal from the hurtful things I said, and how can I help facilitate this healing process with anything other than love, compassion, patience, and affirmations. Do we throw away a golden first love that has rusted because times are hard now, or fight harder to both grow and become the partners we’ve always dreamed of?

After about 2 months, it became apparent that she has a very anxious attachment style stemming from past relationship trust issues. We’ve had more arguments than I think would be healthy after only 6 months, and almost all of them have stemmed from her assuming the worst about what I’m doing/little things, what is going on on social media in posts that I’m tagged in, or what I’m feeling every moment throughout the day.  - We will have an altercation about something, make up, try to have a good day, but then she will try to talk about whatever we agreed to move on from while I’m simply trying to let the normalcy occur in real life rather than revisit it continuously. This leads to more arguments. While she views these altercations as unpleasant, it doesn’t seem like they impact her the way they impact me. Her not trusting me, or not trusting herself to trust me (or whatever the actual reason is), makes me feel awful, and it’s taken me longer and longer to recover from these altercations. After our most recent one, we both acknowledged that we feel “flat”, and unlike the previous arguments I haven’t really bounced back with that deep feeling of love and promise I had. It’s only been a week, but it’s the longest bout of this I’ve experienced.  - I am not void of responsibility here, especially as someone who is much more reserved and introspective, and who has never been very good at sharing feelings. I have my own insecurities that I’ve been working on and have unintentionally done things to trigger her insecurities, but the frequency of our altercations has hit a point where I’m not sure if I’ve fallen out of love and need to end things, or if we've just abruptly ended the honeymoon phase. It’s caused a lot of pain for me but I love this person and I know she loves me. If we split we may miss something great, but I don’t know if or how long we’re supposed to wait to see if the fire gets reignited.  - Does anyone have experience with this? Can two mature adults realistically get through this? I feel like I've been patient and as kind as I can be, but it's exhausting and it just feels like there is so much to untangle that it may be impossible.",1

I explained to her that I was just very cautious to do anything sexual considering that she said from the start that she wanted to take things slow and wasn't used to this kind of physical connection. There's also the fact that up until I met her I thought I was asexual and had no interest at all in that kind of thing (turns out I'm just demisexual, I only feel sexual attraction to people I love), which I told her from the start of our relationship. Still, she said she feels like my passiveness played a big part in her feelings not being the same anymore. I apologized for my mistakes during our relationship, she did the same, and we agreed that most of them could've been solved with a little more communication but she still says she doesn't feel the same about me and doesn't want to go back to us. I asked that she at least leaves her heart open for me to try to reach it again and she said her heart is never closed off to me, she just doesn't feel the same way anymore.   I know I tagged this as advice but I already have my mind made up that I'm not just going to get over it. Of course I'm not going to force anything upon her but I will try to win her back eventually, she is the best thing that ever happened in my life and I know I made her happy too, I'm not going to give that up. I just really want to read other people's thoughts on this whole situation. My best friend says I should wait for at least 3 months before trying anything which to be honest I'm very much okay with, I think we both need time as single individuals before trying to go back to the way we were, I'm just very anxious and scared that she might get over me even more during that time, which I'm definitely not ready for.  Sorry for the long post and possible grammar mistakes, english is not my first language but this is the best page I could find to vent about my situation, thank you for reading!",1
Zuljinnah73,I (21M) hurt my girlfriend's (22F) feeling by saying she says I love you too much.,1,14b08tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14b08tu/i_21m_hurt_my_girlfriends_22f_feeling_by_saying/,6,2023-06-16 15:46:26,relationship_advice,"TL;DR: We were having a good time when I pointed out that she shouldn't say I love you that much which ended up really hurting her feelings and now she doesn't know how to go back.     So you can say my relationship with my girlfriend is at the honeymoon phase. We really love and want each other right now and the honeymoon phase has went for longer than expected which makes me so happy. We are really compatible and basically love doing anything together and are each other's first priority.    We were talking on text last night and having a good time as always when she said I Love You for the 3rd time in 5 minutes because she was so overwhelmed with love for me. I always reply back with i love you too. I dont know why i said at the moment that you just said i love you 2 mins ago and like you shouldn't say it that often because it just undervalues it. A bit of background here would be that I do say random stuff here and there, idk why but thats what makes her like me. So I also said this too not being totally serious.    At that moment she just went to '://' because it was really a mood shifting or heartbreaking thing for her. She said that it just shattered her feelings at that instance and she was so overwhelmed with love at that moment. I know I fucked up bad by saying that, I never realised it. I'll maybe leave my thought process behind saying that at the end of the post. So she cried at that moment and said she doesn't understand how to come back from this because she feels like she cannot naturally and casually say it anymore just like she would and now she's in a shell and can't feel comfortable in expressing her love anymore but that she still loves me. I got really sad at that moment and did not know how to react as I did not want anything to change between us.    But since that moment I tried convincing her to tell me more and more about how she's feeling. She told me that she understands that I say lot of random stuff but there must be some grain of truth to it for the thought to be in my head which really broke her. Even 12 hours after the conversation she's still feeling the same and the energy is not in the conversation anymore. I really don't understand how do I fix this or do we need to give it some time? I really love her and my intentions were not anything near the lines that I do not love her.      My thought process behind saying it:   I know what I said might be wrong and I did not mean it fully but here's what goes through my head. So I know we love each other and saying i love you is not the problem, its just that whenever she says it, I dont know how to reply to it without saying i love you too and whenever I say that, I feel like I am only saying it because she said it. I say it first a lot of times too but I feel like saying it all the time takes the value out of those words. I do tell her i love you so many times. Idk might sound bs to a lot of people but thats the overthinking that goes in my head.",1

I’m dating this guy (38M) and we aren’t in a relationship. Still getting to know each other and honestly we have just been trying to make time for each other.  He came back from a long trip. We went to a park and started talking. I was so happy because we had not seen each other for nearly two months. While we were joking with each other, I said “By the way, you’re not a good cuddler.” He looked offended and said “Yeah I am a good cuddler. You’re just not a good CUDDLEE “. It was so funny we both started laughing  Then he started to say how he tries to cuddle me but I move around a lot. I agreed and laughed but still held my sentiment. The next night, he cuddled me so much, rubbing his hand on my back. Giving and returning kisses on the check. I didn’t realize until the next day that he put more effort into cuddling. It was so sweet. He’s my angel. This isn’t the first time I’ve expressed something I didn’t like and he quietly improved the next time.  He works a lot. He’s usually in serious mode all the time, it seems. He’s usually making a lot of decisions each day and has to take care of his parents’ business on top of his own.  I loved being able to see him relax in my arms, his head on my chest, his eyes closed looking so relaxed. I want to continue being his soft place the way he feels like a soft place for me.",1
Altruistic-Dark3178,I (22f) love my boyfriend (24m) but am scared to tell him,1,13nvd8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13nvd8v/i_22f_love_my_boyfriend_24m_but_am_scared_to_tell/,2,2023-05-21 13:50:49,relationships,"Hi, I guess to get this going I should preface I have never been told I love you by a significant other before. I have had 1 serious past relationship which was on and off for 4 years, and during that time, I was younger and didn’t quite know how love worked. It also wasn’t reciprocated to the same extent so to speak. However, that is just a small background of the past. In my current relationship, my boyfriend and I have been in a together for a little over a year. I have never been treated with so much respect and love. His communication is amazing, he reassures me, is gentle, remembers the little things- he really is the best person to be with.   For the past few months or so, I’ve been falling for everything he does. When he’s sitting down and working on something I just get lost in a trace admiring him. When he’s dancing or laughing I can’t help but stand beside him and smile. No matter what he does I feel as if am in a movie, as cliche as it sounds- everything stops around us and I can’t see anything else but him. When I am with him it’s like color comes into my world and I just am consumed with love. I get lost in his eyes and like writing him cute notes or doing something special for him to show my appreciation. I could go on and on about how he makes me feel and how unique he is as a person. When he falls asleep I brush my hands through his hair because I know how much he likes it, and man it’s the cutest thing to see him so relaxed.   However, I don’t know how to tell him a love him and nervous of his reaction. Today when I was leaving his place, I asked if he wanted to hangout again tomorrow or if he needed time to decompress. He said if I would like to come over he has no problem with that but wanted me to know he will probably be playing video games. I said that is no problem and he replied well but then you just stare at me and if feels weird. Earlier this week I told him he looked very nice in his new shirt and I couldn’t stop blushing because he looked very handsome to me and he said that its a little weird that I gush over him because he feels like he’s put a spell on me or something. Obviously I know he’s not being serious about the spell stuff but after both of these two comments I started over thinking a bit. I don’t mean to stare at him when he’s gaming in a weird way or anything, he just looks so happy and cute so I can’t help but smile at it. I think he’s very handsome and I am vocal with that but am starting to feel like maybe the way I am showing love is weird?   Idk it’s hard to not just be in awe and I really would like to tell him I love him but after these comments I’m not sure if it’s the right time. I don’t want him to think it’s weird. I also don’t know if he’ll say it back, and I know that’s okay since everyone feels love at different points in a relationship and if he’s not there yet I am okay with that. I just don’t want to make him feel weird with me admiring him and then telling him I love him? I’ve almost told him a few times this week but each time I start over thinking and can’t seem to get the words out. I’m not really sure how saying I love you works anymore and I don’t want to make him feel weird since some of my actions already have.  TL;DR: I’ve never been told I love you in a relationship before. In my current relationship I am in absolute awe of my boyfriend and can’t help to show that. At times he has commented it feels a little weird with the attention I give. I want to tell him I love you but I don’t want him to feel weird if I were to express how I feel.",1

After we basically  opened up  to eachother (or rather just talked to one another) i found that we had a lot in common. We instantly became inseparable. She was basically the only person in my life (apart from family) who i really trusted and wanted to be close with. Now, i can't tell if I just really want to be her friend or if I want to be WITH her.  Okay, so, this is basically the first time I'm dealing with what may or may not be a crush so I REALLY need some advice. My friend (who I'll call M) is one of the best people I've ever met. She helped me open up and deal with anxiety. She basically changed my life for the better, and I would NEVER had been able to make other friends (or even have a social life) without her. She helped me be a better person and develop my  personality . Recently, my feelings for her might have changed but I'm not sure.   M is an awesome person. She's smart, nice (for the most part), pretty, has an immaculate personality, and is just overall amazing. I don't know if I have my feelings for her confused or not. Like, I wouldn't mind if she kissed me. As a plus, sometimes, when i see her or when she talks to me, i (maybe) get butterflies. It's just all so confusing.   In general, M is a great person and if I ever tell her about this I'm worried our friendship will waver, or just vanish in all. I don't wanna lose her, plus I don't even know if I have a crush on her or not.  TL;DR: I may be in love with my best friend (who's helped me through alot and is THE complete package) but I'm unsure.",1

Just for context I am M24 and she's F23, so it was not the  teenager  love, it was something more mature and deep. Everything was great and we spent a lot of time together, we met each other nearly every day for several hours. I think we also developed a sort of dépendance with each other (more in a bad way than in a great way).  We were imaging and building a future together and that's the only time in my life that i went along with a person so much.  I found that i live the love and the relationships in a really deep way. Now I can't imagine myself loving someone else, everything i could potentially do with a new person appears in my head with her. But I'm curious of your stories.  What does it feels like to love someone else after the first love?  Is it totally different?   Was it difficult to accept that maybe you could never meet a person to  love in the same way  (with its pros and cons)?

Also, English isn’t my first language, so please do bear with me!  I (27F) have a best friend (30M) whom I’ve not met physically, yet. We “met” on a social media platform almost 4 years back, and he has been my best friend since more than 2 years now. He’s been the best thing happened to me ever. There are many different layers to our friendship, and I truly believe he’s my soulmate (if that concept does indeed exist in any dimension of reality). We were talking over the phone recently, and I said something goofy, like, “I’ll love you even if you stay dumb forever”. He liked it (because he has a weird sense of humour like I do). I continued listing things and he started “would you love me if..” as well. This went back and forth. One thing lead to another, he said he’d love it if I could write it as a poem or a song lyric for real. Oh, he’s a music composer, btw! I said, “absolutely not happening”. But I had already decided the moment he asked me if I could write, that I would do it even if it turns out to be an absolute disaster. I wrote a few lines yesterday. Some funny lines, some silly ones, and other truly assuring things to show how much I adore and love this gem of a human being he is. I desperately wanted him to like it, but didn’t really expect him to actually do like it. Because, I’m one of those people who doesn’t think she can do a decent job at anything. Well, he loved it. He loved not just my gesture, he loved my poetry (or whatever that was). I have been going through tough phase in life since a few years now, and he just made my day. I love him for how much he makes me want to love myself.  And IF anyone is curious at all, yes, I do love this man with everything in me down to the last atom and molecule. But we are not in a romantic relationship due to life circumstances. Wish life were a simpler thing. But no much complaints as long as I have him in my life!  Thank you for reading my post! :)",1

So, I've been seeing some girl for about 6 months... nothing is official but we hang out, go on dates, stays over, and have been intimate. The girls from work, I am 30 and she is 28.   However, my friend who works on the same team has always been friendly with her... he's 22 and with all due respect he is not good looking. Only work friends, they've never spoke outside of work prior  Since we've been hooking up, she's been speaking to him about me and obviously asking for advice etc, seeing as he knows me quite well from work.  However recently he has been seeing her outside of work, going for walks and such to  speak . He keeps saying he needs to speak to her about his issues too.   He constantly texts her when we are out together, texts he misses her and he loves her (in a joking way, but I'm starting to think there is more to it now). He keeps dragging her away in work to speak to her. I don't want to say anything as she's free to do as she wishes. But it is starting to get me down as it's so obvious.  He doesn't contact me anymore since he's started to go for walks...  She did say to me that she thinks maybe he might like her but doesn't know what to say because she doesn't like him in that way. I didn't really carry the conversation on as I don't want to come across as  that guy   I'm not concerned at all anything will happen between them - that isnt my issue. However, it's bothering me that it's affecting my time with her... I don't know what he could be saying too... and I feel kind of betrayed by him.  I want to confront him but, I'm pretty sure he won't admit that he does like her. Then, I feel he may go back and say I am trying to stop them being friends?  How do I go about this? Do I just cut ties and keep it professional in work? Do I confront him (what do I say), or do I speak to her?",1

We've known each other for several years, but only began officially dating in November. Last Monday they came to me and said they needed space to work on themselves because the side effects were hitting them pretty hard. I convinced them that we can try  taking a break  till their medication situation has settled and reassess then rather than break-up outright. They told me they didn't love me anymore and that they couldnt really feel emotions at all. They also made it clear that even after they try different medications, they still might not love me anymore but hopes we can still be friends.   I've been doing my best to cope, but it feels like waiting on them to feel better is consuming my days. I feel like I pressured them into staying with me when they really wanted to break it off conpletely.

I know it isn't their fault, but my heart feels like it's breaking and I'm starting to not be able to hold it together any more.   I've been spending a lot of time reading old texts from them from back when they loved me. I don't know if that's doing more harm than good at this point.

Also, I feel like I can't go to them like I used to be able to with my problems. Whenever we had an issue before we could talk it out and make a plan together. Now I feel like I can't go to them with any of this because it would make them resent me for being selfish.

Although we are both pretty loose with our beliefs and morals (lol) we both grew up in church. I’m no saint, i’ve done my fair share of dumb stuff throughout the years and even now, but she helps keep me in check and I love it. I have never believed in love at first sight, but guys when I tell you that I still to this day remember the first time we looked each other in the eye, it was something that I could not deny. We were both just so instantly attracted to each other from the moment we both stepped into the same room. We were both genuinely so in love, and to this day I love this girl with everything that I am and I don’t want to hurt her. After we met, we dated for a year and we were split up (wasn’t our decision). The next two years we’re spent without communication, and seeing other people. In this two year period, we both had dated 1 other person. My relationship didn’t last very long and it didn’t go very far. My girlfriends previous relationship, however, was very mentally, verbally, and slightly physically abusive. She was also cheated on multiple times. (it’s sad that I have to clarify, but there are text and photo evidence of stalking, bruises on the body, etc. So yes this is a case of actual abuse, it is not attention seeking). Because of her past relationship, it is very hard for her to trust people. After reconnecting and being in a committed relationship with me for 15 days short of a year, she still does not trust me. Everything was completely fine up until about 3 months into our relationship. Out of absolutely nowhere, she would just start questioning me about my past relationships and the “things” i’ve done with them, how many times, when, where, and how. She genuinely felt and acted like I owed her those answers. She would say that she needs to know all of it, because if she doesn’t know the specifics then she’ll sit in her free time and her mind will fill up all the spaces that I didn’t fill in. There have been at least 7 or 8 times where my girlfriend has ended our relationship because i refused to answer questions like this. I’m not one to chase if someone ends a relationship, I let things be. So when she tells me that she’s ending our relationship over something as stupid as what i’m presenting to you, I ask her if that’s what she wants. Her response is almost always a yes, followed by cursing and name calling… only to apologize an hour later. “I’m sorry i messed up i know i shouldn’t have said those things”. I refuse to answer something absurd, she ends the relationship, apologizes. As easy as it is to get super frustrated that i’m stuck in this cycle, I have to constantly remind myself that I have physically seen what her past relationship was like. I know what she has been through. Outside of our relationship this woman is the most affectionate and loving person I have ever known. She makes it very known that she loves me. Outside of our arguments everything is perfect. I know that she is going to be more difficult to love and commit to than any average person. But do her past experiences give her the right to put somebody through that? Can somebody please tell me if her actions are justified? 11 months down the road, her and I both have initiated breakups multiple times. Most arguments ended with me swallowing my tongue and apologizing for things that I shouldn’t have had to apologize for. If I was the one who took the initiative to end our relationship, she would blow my phone up for about a day or 2. She would ask if i’m really going to end our relationship just because I don’t want to answer how many times i’ve done things in a car (example). As I said before, she truly felt like I owed her the answered to questions like this. She would sit and think about all of the things I could have possibly done with my exes if I didn’t answer them (according to her). If I let it go on longer than a day or two, she would apologize and ask for me to come see her. Currently, she is taking the initiative to see a counselor, but no matter how much things improve I can’t see her as anything but someone who towers over me. As much as I love this girl, I feel like she will get mad at anything I say. I say sorry for practically everything I do. Not only do I not feel equal to her, it feels like i’m not allowed to have a life outside of her. She is a church girl and she does keep me in check. I don’t cheat, let me make that clear, but she makes sure that i’m not doing things that I know i’m not supposed to be doing (lol). With that being said, because of previously mentioned trust issues, she despises anyone I come into contact with. My best friend lives in New Hampshire, my girlfriend isn’t too fond of my best friends girlfriend. Because of this, I am not allowed to go visit my best friend if I want to keep my relationship, just to prevent any chances that I would sleep with my best friends girlfriend. I have not, in any way, shape, or form showed myself to be that type of person. But because of her trauma, I cannot visit my best friend. I don’t know if my mind is just trying to convince myself to be with her, but something in the back of my mind just feels like she just wants the best for me, and that I would go off the rails without the stability she gives me. On the other hand, I love my girlfriend to death, but it really just feels like she towers over me constantly. She can do whatever she wants whenever she wants, when i’m not allowed to do anything at all. Everyone that I talk to just tells me to end it, but they don’t understand how good things are when we aren’t arguing. I don’t know what else to say I just need outside opinions please. thank you very much for your time",1

Since she got thinner it's more or less common for someone to make a pass at her from time to time, and since she was transparent about it, I knew I could trust her.But in the last few months I noticed that her friendship with this co-worker was getting closer.  They text each other on the phone regularly, and at work they text each other a lot too from what she tells me.Last week we went out for dinner with some of her coworkers, including Jack. And I was struck by the way my girlfriend was talking and looking at him. I had a feeling there was something more than friendship there, but I thought it might be my imagination.  Today I asked her directly, and she admitted that she likes Jack, but that she wants to distance herself from him because she loves me and wants to stay with me (I was planning to ask her to marry me this year, and she knows that).This has shaken the confidence I had on her because I don't think she would have told me if I hadn't asked her directly.  She cheated on her previous partner, although it is true that when she did it the relationship was already pretty much dead, but still. I don't think she cheated on me, but I do think they have been flirting.Now, I don't know if I have done the right thing here.  But I have checked her phone messages, and yes they have flirted a bit.She told him that she was grateful to have met him because he made work so much more entertaining. And on another occasion she mentioned to him why she hadn't told her how pretty she looked that day. She told him she liked his outfit after they've met. Stuff like that.  I know it may not be much, but when I asked her directly if she had flirted with Jack, she said no (repeatedly).I don't know what to do. I love her so much, but I don't know if I can trust her anymore. I need advice.  &#x200B;  TLDR: My gf recognized she likes a coworker, but says she loves me. I wanna trust her, but I don't know if I can.",1

He was very kind and intelligent and I felt comfortable in his presence. He followed up with me after our coffee date to say he had a wonderful experience and wanted to meet again. I, however, had gotten divorced prior (he was aware) and I must have gotten cold feet - I explained that I didn’t feel as ready to date again as I had thought, and he said he understood and to keep him in mind in the future. I left it at that.  Now: I would like to follow up with this person, actually, and I’d love to go out with him again… but we had only communicated via the dating app on which we matched. I no longer have my old account on that app, and I have not seen him again on the app with my current account. All I have is his first name and the name of the academy he works at - but I was able to find him easily by googling just that information. His email address is listed on the website, so I have a way to contact him. Should I send him an email to ask him out, or is it just too weird? It’s either that, or nothing :/  tl;dr: I went out with someone who liked me back and asked me to follow up in the past, then I lost his contact info, but found his email address via a simple Google search.

Stormzilla,"I know ""the other person"" in an affair probably isn't deserving of much sympathy, but it can be painful.",170,14fa10q,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/14fa10q/i_know_the_other_person_in_an_affair_probably/,285,2023-06-21 14:59:52,love,"For five years, I had an affair with a female coworker. The relationship developed organically, but quickly, and we began sleeping together within a couple months. As time progressed, we moved beyond just sleeping together, and went on dates around the city, spoke on the phone fairly regularly, texted daily, and even went on a couple of brief, weekend trips. This relationship had its stops and starts, but was more-or-less ongoing for nearly five years.   During this entire time, she had a serious boyfriend with whom she shared an apartment (honestly, I am not sure how she pulled this off, but she apparently did). I remained single throughout, sometimes neglecting to pursue legitimate relationships because of my connection to this woman.  Eventually, expressions of love were shared (her first) and a deep intimacy grew. I know when people think of affairs, the sex part of it is the first thing that comes to mind, but real substance and intimacy can develop in an affair. We had a bond.  A few months ago, the relationship ended. I wish I could say it was my decision, but it was not. We no longer work together, which is good, but the loss of this relationship has still been difficult for me.  I am not really expecting sympathy from anyone. I knew while the relationship was happening that it was unethical. I also realize that as much as I may have cared for this person (and they seemingly cared for me), they were deeply deceptive, and someone with whom a romantic relationship is a bad idea. And I obviously have some serious flaws of my own.  The main thing I want to express, I guess, is that *being the other person, particularly after the relationship is over, feels deeply lonely.*  Almost no one in my life ever knew this relationship occurred. I confided in a couple of friends about what was going on, and they tried to be understanding, but ultimately felt the relationship was a bad idea (they were right), and encouraged me to end it. I also told one of my sisters about the affair, and she had the same reaction. Otherwise, this relationship was hidden from everyone.  I hate to admit this, but this relationship was possibly the most meaningful one of my life, more than any one I had with actual girlfriends. It brought me a great deal of joy (and pain), took up the bulk of my thirties, and left a real impact on me. And it happened entirely in the shadows. Usually, if someone gets out of a long-term relationship, their family and friends are there to listen, commiserate, comfort, etc. I feel like none of that is accessible to me.  I have a therapist with whom I have discussed this relationship, and that has helped, but it is still difficult for me to feel like a relationship that was central to my life for years in some ways never really existed.  This might read like a pity party. Again, that is not the point. I feel like I just need to get some of these thoughts out of my head and express them *somewhere.*   Thanks for reading.  **Edit:** It is fascinating to read the range of responses here. From sympathy to commiseration to  fuck this whiny piece of shit.   I am not surprised that a lot of people here are excoriating me. That's fine. That's Reddit. I will address one assertion I've seen thrown around a lot, though: I did and do feel remorse for my behavior (cue people saying that if I felt remorse I would have ended the relationship). What I did, by staying in this relationship for as long as I did, was a terrible thing to do to her boyfriend. I could say more about that, but *it wasn't the point of my post.* My post *was* self-involved, because the point of it was about the sense of loss and loneliness I have been feeling. It wasn't about the remorse I felt and feel.  This is likely just more fuel for some people's fire. So be it.  **Edit #2:** First, thanks to everyone who offered insight, support, or even reasonable criticism. I really appreciate it.  To all the people who hopped on here to tell me what a horrible person I am, it is really easy to play cosmic avenger and judge strangers on the internet. I knew some people would condemn me for my post, but I didn't expect anyone to tell me I should contemplate suicide, or to have 30+ other people call me names and tell me that I belong in hell. This is the **LOVE** subreddit, where * We talk about all things having to do with love!

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.  On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).  Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface .  This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.  This is not only about moderators, either. This affects users, as well, including [vulnerable communities like the visually impaired.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1404hwj/mods_of_rblind_reveal_that_removing_3rd_party/)  # What's the plan?  On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.  The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.  # What can you do?  1. **Complain.** Message the mods of [r/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/).com, who are the admins of the site: message [/u/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/reddit/): submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on [r/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/), such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post. 2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits.

He has been suffering with depression for over two years, so at first I didn’t say anything and was just keeping tabs on their messages. I know he won’t physically cheat because he won’t leave the house.  I thought maybe he was feeling neglected because I’ve been busy with our children, taking care of the house, working, and taking care of him. So I tried to show him how much he’s loved and how he’s so important to our family.  Still the messages keep happening. So i do some digging on her and find out she’s a catfish… she’s 20-30 years older than she said she was and she’s been relying on filters to mask the weight.  So I calmly talk to my husband about how much I love him and our family and that I know about him and this other woman. That I want marriage counselling and that he needs to go to therapy on his own as well. He agreed, which was a huge deal because he has been refusing to get help. Then I show him the proof that she’s not a 20 something beauty but really a grandma.  He was very upset agreed to counselling and then asked if we could never speak of her again, which I gladly agreed to.  Now a month later he’s stalking her profiles and telling a friend how much she’s on his mind, that he wishes she was real and they could have married, and he’s just constantly lost in thought about this woman that never really existed.  I love him deeply and I’m fighting to get my husband back from this catfish. I know he’s hurting and he was such a vibrant and compassionate guy before the depression hit. The way he’s acting now isn’t him, and I’m not going to give up on him when he’s down. The man I fell in love with is still in there and he’s such a patient and loving father.  Please help. How do I get my husband to let this woman go? How do I get my husband to see that his heart should go to the woman he married and sacrifices so hard to help him?",1

This usually manifests as me experiencing anxiety about my relationship and me wanting a hug and verbal reassurance.   My partner can find this difficult, especially the physical reassurance as it can make her feel like i question how much she cares, I don’t I just want to hear it sometimes. We’ve spoken about it, I’m aware of the process in my mind and how my anxiety is fundamentally my own creation.   I’m not sure what strategies I can implement to deal with this.I have been through CBT and am a diagnosed bipolar I. Unmedicated but generally stable. I would say this only tends to crop up when we’re in the same space, when she’s elsewhere it doesn’t usually come up.   Thanks for reading, all advice appreciated.",1

When she would attempt to take control, I would literally go soft. It was such a turnoff for me. When I attempted to take control, she would be resistant.   We like each other so much that we have decided to see if this can work. We still talk constantly and have insanely incredible chemistry in every aspect except for sex. I agreed to let her be on top when I see her this weekend. I have withheld from masturbating for a week in hopes it will let me stay horny enough while I am trying to be submissive.   Is there hope for us? I really really like her.",1

No one likes a know it all, so I pretend not know some facts and now he is angry with me.  English is not my first language so I’m sorry for any mistakes. Me (29F) and my boyfriend (27M) have been dating for 6 months and so far things have been very good, until this weekend.  The thing about me is that I love to read non-fiction, listen to podcasts and watch documentaries, mostly on facts that aren’t useful in my daily life. I learned about natural disasters, business problems, historic facts, extinct animals, movies background stories. I can easily spend whole afternoons lost on a Wikipedia black hole. I watch a bunch of different news channels, even international ones.  I also learned really early in my school life that no one likes a know it all. People likes to explain things to you, and feel good to learn things that you don’t. If you always entering the conversation with “oh, I read/listened/watched about this”, very quickly you will found yourself unliked. So everytime I met someone new, I express interest in what they talk about without saying what I know about it. Or I say I don’t know much about the subject even if I do know. I acted like this with my boyfriend too, and I really didn’t mind listening to him talk anything, even if I have more knowledge about the subject.  This weekend we met some longtime friends of mine, so they know about my habits. This came to light multiple times during the weekend and even more during some table top games we played. My boyfriend is not stupid and clearly realised I have pretended to know about things he told me that I actually thought my friends in the past.  When we left, he accused me of being a liar. I tried to tell him it was only white lies to have good conversations with him, and how I knew that me expressing my knowledge would be annoying. He told me that since I lied about such minor things, he doesn’t know how much more I could lie about. The conversation ended two days ago and he haven’t talked to me since. How can I fix this? I didn’t think pretending not know some useless trivia would end up like this. I’m not even sure if what I did was this bad. Could really use some advice…",1

The only such things I have read was one from Stephen King called  The Bone Church , which is in a short story collection called  The Bazaar of Bad Dreams . I am also reading Edgar Allan Poe´s work which I dont know if all of it can be called horror. They can dark though. Have not read all of it yet, so there might be some darker poems yet to find. And I guess Dante´s Inferno can come close to horror at times. With some of the depictions of hell.   So I am very interested in hearing what this community thinks about using poetry to write horror.

I struggle with mental health and at that I receeved very little help or understanding for it. I also have a history of selfharm which im not proud of, but i gues i feel like it does kinda belong to the story. Back than i used to play a lot of videogames, i liked it, it kept me busy and just helped me not to do something stuppid.   I was playing advanced warfare (you can judge me but this is my favourite cod ever) a lot back than. Around that time I met a pretty nice guy, me and my only two friends at that time were clubbing and i met a pretty nice guy. He was pretty awkward, like he seemdd to be coping so hard about being social and just made jokes and tried to be like weird to be funny. It was interesting, cause objectively, from a womens perspective he had no reason to be selfaware or anything like that, he was an good looking worked out guy. I somehow got into a conversation with him. And in my heavily drunk manner I started talking about videogames. He went with it and also talked about gamds, at some point i basicly am drunk enough to not rrmember anything, but i gues it became apparent that i wasnt doing great. Also i somehow gave this guy my number and he called me the next day, asking how i was and so on, and he than asked if i wanted to play videogames. And so we got to play together.  A couple weeks later I was once again doing pretty bad and at that point it had lasted a couple days and i didnt go out or anything and took no phonecalls. Well i than wanted to play AW and this surtain guy was online and he messaged me, how are you? You wanna play? And so on. I difnt want to be with anyone, especialy because he was in a party with other ppl i didnt know, i just wasnt feeling it so i wrote no. I play on my own and suddenly he writes about his dog that he had passed away and that he felt pretty down. (his dog had infsct died, it was no lie) He would go on the genuently guilttripp me into playing with them and it was probably the best time i had doing anything for a such a long time at that point. And we would start playing regulary and just becoming realy good friends.  Fast forward, Im in a 6 year long relationship and I till this day play videogames with the same group of ppl (there are a couple more ppl now, from wotk and still clubbing). These ppl are my closest friends and Im pretty confident I wouldnt be here without them and my now bf.  I hope you enjoyed my little story.",1

(4m committed)   I never like the idea her clubbing, but as long as i can reach her and know where she is, who she’s with and is safe. I’m okay. I saw her got irresponsibly drunk 2 times early in our dating, so i’m a bit worried.  A month ago we went on a vacation at an island where there’s a famous local cannabis strain. So i asked hey i want to try them, she says ok but after i smoked. She got really MAD and i spent the entire day try to make up with her and eventually i did, with accepting her ultimatum about not ever smoking again.  So of course i did, relationship are more important than any substances for me. But here’s the other part, i also side hustle by selling cannabis, 100% legal where i live and it’s a legit business. She’s also against it and gave me ultimatum that after i sold out this inventory. I must close my business.  Meanwhile, when all of this happen, only thing i ask from her is stop clubbing, but i never gave her any ultimatum. My group of best friends don’t like go out drinking but we prefer to smoke and chill. I gave that up for her so at least i’d like her to stay with me and do some activities together.  She never had any reasoning behind those ultimatums except “she doesn’t like it”. While i argue with facts and informations about dangers of alcohol and why it concerns me.   I don’t really know what to do anymore, i don’t even want to go back smoking weed either because it actually feels nice after quitting. But it’s the fact that she gave me ultimatums one after another while refuse to even work with my boundaries with legit reasoning about her clubbing.  I really love her but am i disrespecting myself way too much for allowing her to do this to me? Is there anything i can do besides throw the ultimatum back?   Thanks for any advice!  Tl;dr gf gave ultimatum on weed use and business but will go clubbing regardless of my concerns.",1

We both have 22 years. The apparent reason was that we drifted apart for a couple of weeks because of college, we had a fight, and then she kissed one of her friends. That destroyed her, to this day she feels like garbage and she can't bear the guilt of what she did. She doesn't understand why it happened, she just started to like that boy and she suppressed her feelings until everything exploded because of the bad moment she had with me. In general we both blame much more the difficult circumstances of our lives, psychological, university, family and economic problems. She neglected everything a lot to dedicate herself completely to her studies.   The day after the kiss he told me everything, he apologized and cried a lot. But at the same time she communicated her desire to end the relationship. At that time I accepted without many buts, but it was not what I wanted. Throughout the latter we both reflect on the true causes of the breakup. These could be: monotony, lack of emotional communication, stagnation in our activities and loss of the individual due to the desire to please the couple. Because of that, she lost a lot of interest in me. Because I wasn't going through a good time in my life, and I really think she realized that things would be boring with me. We did not have many arguments in our relationship, and we have always enjoyed each other's company very much.   Generally speaking, we were never in a toxic relationship. But if a somewhat careless and took everything for granted.Because of that, I started working on my motivation to get her back. I managed to change my life, and my impatience made me want to get back to her quickly. We saw each other three times during that month, the point was the same. Determine if she wanted to come back, and even though I never begged, I did push her a little. I behaved too complacent and it cost me a lot of work to understand the main reason for her refusal. She wanted time to work on her problems, to clear her feelings and forget all the pain that the breakup caused her. Just today, after a request from her for distancing, we reached an agreement. You see, she hasn't stopped loving me. And it's not just assumptions or lies on her part, she continually shows it when we're together. She kisses me, she hugs me, she cares about me. She is sure that she loves me, likes me and without a doubt desires me. But she understands that we are emotionally damaged and she doesn't want to promise that we can be together again so she doesn't torture me with waiting. She doesn't want to commit to wanting to be with me after the estrangement. Our agreement was as follows: there will be no contact of any kind for 2 months. The goal is to heal and work on our goals, desires and problems. After that we will see each other not to determine if we want to be together, but to determine if we want to start over again. To flirt again and all that, to perhaps start a new relationship. The rules are simple, exclusivity (to actually respect the duel) and communication only in an emergency. Naturally during that time I will continue as before, exercise, study, socializing and many many hobbies.  What opinion do you have of the situation? Please make assumptions under the idea that she really broke up with me because we needed to. Not because she doesn't love me or because she wants to be with someone else. She's not a bad person, she just has a lot of problems. Although she does make me feel bad that she has been so determined to end the relationship. It's as if despite her fears, she has the conviction that it's the right thing to do. But I suppose that could change, I haven't given her much space this month and she hasn't had time to think about the situation in peace, again because of the university. She's the type of person who could sleep 3 hours a day when the going gets tough, just because she's obsessed with getting a good grade.Do I have any chance of getting back with her? I really want to heal, leave my pain behind and accept what happened. When we meet again I would like to be ready to fall in love with her again and for everything to work again, but this time better. Any advice? Is our two-month plan a good idea?  \*\*TL;DR; :My girlfriend ended a relationship with me for 4 and a half years. It seems that she deelpy loves me, likes me and wants me very much. But she has many personal problems, our relationship has deteriorated and this situation hurts both of us. We decided to isolate ourselves from each other for two months. It will work? She doesn't know if we'll be back, I want to. What should I do?\*\*",1

To care about the world and its dazzling glory with every neuron, atrium, spiritual essence. It's about automatically bonding to the beauty in the world around you. Searching for the light in blackened night. The fire that makes the soul tic. To be empathic is to know and understand love because you offer it unconditionally. It's natural. The Imperfections in humanity have room for forgiveness. Our world is far from perfect unfortunately. The cruelty of the world can weigh heavy on the shoulders of the compassionate. The indifference in the apathetic is disheartening. The injustice is overwhelming. Conceding is not an option. The power of the ripple effect is not to be underestimated or overlooked. Choosing morality in the face of adversity can be difficult. The impact will enrich humanity's intrapersonal relationship, especially if it's practiced by the masses. It's something to ponder….

We had a lot of classes and extracurriculars in common. I took a liking to him at a very young age, but was always scared to really try to be with him. I ended up dating and crushing on other people throughout this time and after, but none were quite the same as I always came back to thinking about him.  Fast forward to after high school and us being midway through university. I felt like I had finally improved myself enough to directly make a move. He had a monogamous girlfriend at the time and we lived really far apart, so he rejected me, which was fine, but we had hit it off so we kept flirting (mistake, I know).   I opened up to him about my guilt. He freaked out and had me delete our message history. He said we could just be friends. I was disappointed, but glad just to keep him in my life. A few days after, when we were having a nice text conversation, my phone died in the middle of it. When I turned it back on, he was talking about having cold feet about even being friends. I told him this would really hurt me, but he went through with blocking me on all platforms we had each other.  This was at a really bad time in my life. I felt like so much had been ripped from me. I spiraled. When I was suicidal and talked to one of my friends (28M?) about it, he reached out to my now-boyfriend and manipulated him into talking to me on Snapchat saying it was an emergency. I was mortified and clarified that this was against my wishes when he did message me, that I found it highly embarrassing, and that though it hurt me he didn't have to talk to me. He was understanding and chose to continue to not be friends. I ended that friendship with the guy who reached out to him over it.  This was until over a year later. About a week after breaking up with his then-gf (23F? at the time), he started messaging me again  anonymously.  I called him on it quickly, though I was just happy he was in my life again. I asked him to unblock me on the other places and he did. He promised not to block me again and we agreed to be friends no matter what.  When he had rejected me before, he had said he would date me if he were single and found me very attractive. However, he had changed his mind and said he didn't have the time nor did he want a long distance relationship. Okay, fine, so we continued our flirting and sexting.  A few months later, he was in a monogamous long distance relationship with another woman. This hurt me a lot, but we continued sexting and talking about visiting anyway. We called on the holidays, I emailed him on work trips, and he was good about talking to me. After a while though, he got cagey and started avoiding calls.   When I pressed him on this, he completely ghosted me. I was devastated. I had just moved and was already in a very bad, frequently suicidal headspace. (He did not know this, to be fair.) It was extremely painful for me. It made me feel like I had no value. I felt paranoid that someone turned him against me or he might not even be alive. (He had removed most social media in that time.) It was awful.  He came back and I swallowed my pride. He eventually seemed open to dating so I agreed. Things went well, but I knew not to open up to him about our relationship problems anymore, as I knew he was likely to just flake or ghost again. Things are wonderful as long as I can keep them like this. It's been about a year. My friends are still wary of him, but are softening.  He brought up the marriage question, though, and I felt hesitant, especially since both of us want kids. I am afraid to marry and have kids with someone I find flaky and untrustworthy. He knowingly hurt me and broke his word multiple times over the course of years. There was never any indication he now views me as valuable and can be relied on during tough times. Maybe agreeing to a relationship changed things in his mind, but I am too afraid to test things to find out.  I am in a more stable position in my life and a suicidal spiral is doubtful, but I don't know where my mind might go if he just casts me aside again. I have never been this satisfied in any of my other relationships and would always leave within a few months. Everyone got compared to him in my mind.   I can't just ask him direct questions and trust his responses, because I know he is someone who just... says things to say them. His words don't hold weight. His apologies and promises meant nothing. Should I talk to him about this? How can I bring it up?  **TL;DR: Boyfriend used to view me only as an online side piece, made false promises, repeatedly cut me off and rejected me. Our relationship since has been good, but I don't trust him at all, and now he wants to get married.**",1

We clicked and all of a sudden we were dating. It was like that joke “I’m so hot I’ll turn you straight” and we joked about it a lot. Then we first slept together. For me it was a first ever, and for her a first ever with a guy. Obviously it was mediocre and awkward physically, since neither of us knew what best to do, but we still both had an enjoyable time which is the most important part and I thought nothing more of it, except that I know it will only get better physically and I’m perfectly able to stay patient until it does. Then about half a week later a stroke of reality must have struck her and out of no where she broke up with me, her reason being that while she had a nice time with me, she was scared that she prefers sleeping with women, so as well as we vibed, she wanted to stay friends so she didn’t get sick of sleeping with a man later down the line and leave me after we were much more invested. To me this made complete sense, and while obviously sad, I accepted it and moved on. We stayed great friends until about a week later, she started talking about how she was thinking it through, and she likes me as a person so much, that she’d be happy committing to me even though I am a guy. We got back together which I was happy about since whether we were friends or more, I just knew she made me happy and more comfortable with myself than ever.  Things went great from here. We learned good intercourse techniques, both enjoyed every part about our relationship, and it was all like heaven. Then fast forward to a week and a half ago, and after knowing her for so long, I started noticing something strange. She felt distant, didn’t talk with such passion, lost so much colour of her beautiful personality, and sure enough, soon after she told me she wanted to talk. She immediately welled up as she talked about how she’d being fighting herself over the past week but had sadly come to the conclusion that she is in fact lesbian. She loved everything about me and even the sex was great, but it just didn’t feel right to her. Even though we were so close, when she thought about her future she pictured marrying a woman, not a man. The thing she said from the very start was right, and I was stunned that it truly did come back to haunt me.   Things ended weirdly. We decided to be friends, yet we were still attracted to each other, still in love even. It was so weird. What she had said made complete sense, she loved me right now but she didn’t want to hurt me in the future if she found a woman she was attracted to later on.  However yet again, only 2 days later this time, she told me how conflicted she was and how much she missed me. She truly does love me as a person and it broke her heart her having to leave me just because I’m a male.   We got back together but things were different this time. She was distant again. She wasn’t being a bad person but she wasn’t the person I knew. I think the fear that she might prefer women stuck with her and she couldn’t get it out of her head. The next few times we slept together, she reported feeling less emotional connection too me, even thought it was still pleasurable.  Then finally two nights ago, she talked with me one last time, and confirmed that even through all this, still being so close to me, and still having such a strong connection, that she is once and for all a lesbian. This time it was bitter. We broke up cleanly but after all this effort, her physical needs won out. And I understood that.  Both in tears we went to our own homes, and cried ourselves to sleep.  She apologises frequently as she feels like she unintentionally played with my feelings over and over, but I don’t know what to feel. Whole thing’s felt like a series of nightmares and dreams. It’s such a weird situation, yet still in a way makes sense. I still love her. Don’t know if I ever won’t. But above all I want her to be happy, and if that requires her to be with a woman, then so be it.  I don’t really know why I came here, I don’t think anything can be done, but for any of you who got to here and have any advice, I’m all ears. Or even anyone that has any similar situations at all so I know I’m not alone.  Thank you if you read all this. It’s been quite the ride. Any help appreciated x  TL;DR I was in a relationship with a girl who thought she was gay, then fell in love with me so thought she was bisexual, but now is realising she really as gay as she wants me to have a women’s body even though she loves me as a person and I don’t know if there’s anything I can do.",1
TheFuzzyRacoon,I think I'm gonna give up on dating and just love my friend for the rest of my life.,51,13uefi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/13uefi4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_on_dating_and_just_love/,62,2023-05-28 23:27:37,love,"This is gonna be long.  So i (m) was talking to a friend (f) who I'm ironically secretly in love with, I've known her for 20+ years, and she was complaining to me how all, or almost all, of the male friends she has, end up liking her or want something from her sexually and that this has made her learn to basically distrust all males (at least in this regard).  Of course while she's saying this, i feel terrible bc I'm sure she kinda just sees me as one more on the list. Even worse is that i flirt so she might even think I'm one of the ones that are just desperate to sleep with her. I'm not. But because of the disdain when talking about them of course i felt hurt. I was hurt bc she was super minimizing (or at least not acknowledging) how much it hurts to be in love with a girl you're friends with and she has zero interest in you.  Anyway, after this, and even a bit before this, I've been thinking lately that i might be done. I've gone through life as  one of the good ones  in terms of males, and I've just gotten repeatedly basically used or ignored. I've dated before, slept with many women, I'm even divorced now so I've had a whole ass marriage, and i can't tell you how many times I've fallen for a friend only for it to end up with me be being used or cut off. I'll admit it's hard to know for sure if you're being used but effectively, it almost always ended up feeling like being used.  Now i want to be clear. I'm not going the incel route, no. I know they're many men out there who try to use the fact that they aren't successful as a way to blame women, and i just want to be clear, this isn't that. That is wrong, at the end of the day most women just want a friend without having to deal with a guy falling in love just because they're the opposite sex and i get it. And no one owes anyone anything just because someone loves them. So this isn't an attack on women, it's more of a frustration with standards, the way the game of romance is played, and just the difference in men and women that make men less picky while making women more picky. And how I happen to fit in those dynamics.  But after this last time i think I'm truly done. I'm in this exact same position once again. In this case I didn't fall in love with her simply because she's a girl who's there. My feelings for her started when we were children and so I've had these feelings in one way or another for almost 30 years. I've never felt anything so strong in my entire life. It's like i know, i know at the core of my being, that i want this woman and none other. And so i think I'm just gonna give up. If i have to be a friend for the rest of my life, so be it. But i know i definitely don't want to start with another woman who couldn't possibly match up to the feeling i get from her. I know I'll never be satisfied. And i know i have urges, but like again, I'm so over (as a man) basically having to fake court a woman in order to have (just) sex. And people will say, but there are women out there who want just sex, sure, but that is so freaking rare and what's worse is that, then you have to hope that's what you're looking for in a sexual partner.  I guess I'm just over the whole game of love, dating, and trying to satisfy sexual needs. There's a lot to say about men and how bad what they do is. But the honest truth is, as a guy who is well aware of the patriarchal framing of our society, and as someone who is well aware of how men are viewed (and rightly so in a lot of cases). It feels hopeless, i can't find a love because I found the love of my life already, and none of them will be her, what's more, finding sexual partners basically requires me to lie. I'm just so done. The funniest part is that I'm a pretty good looking guy at that, so i can only imagine how bad it is for guys who  don't look good  or don't meet the  normal standards .  Sorry to anyone who read this and thought it was gonna be something else. This was just literally a shower thought i had based on what i feel I'm going to do after once a freaking gain being caught in an unrequited love in my 30s.",1

What I can't wrap my head around our some of the text messages that he sends me. They come out of nowhere and feel a little nuts to me. I don't know if I'm the one being a jerk here but I don't know what to make of them. I've told him it puts me off but he doesn't seem to hear me.   This is an example of one he sent today after he video called at lunch. I answered but he hung up and wouldn't answer when I called back. I left a message saying I guess he didn't have service and couldn't answer but just call back if it's important.   His reply was  What would b the point in answering after seeing u are dressed make up on and hair done? That tells me u have been up for hours and in that time I guarantee that ur phone has been in ur hand a lot and never once did u have the desire or want to call or text and say hello good morning I love u or even fuck off for that matter. And that makes me feel like shit to b real honest. So I didn't answer.     5 minutes later I got this  And because you still have nothing to say, that just tells me I was right   This kind of thing is getting more frequent. I feel like it's kind of excessive but he says it feels like I don't love him. I don't even know how to respond honestly.  Update: I packed a bag, my laptop, gun, important paperwork, etc. Most of my stuff is in storage because we were supposed to move at the end of the month. I didn't want to leave him there but his texts got really ugly when I told him it was over. I feel a lot safer at my friend's house out of town. The barrage of texts have gone from nasty to desperate to accusing me of lying and never caring about him to him taking photos of gifts he supposedly bought me to threatening to hurt himself and me. Apparently I'm   not giving a shit about it but here I sit trying to fucking talk to you and work this fucking thing out because I care more about you than I do the lies. I love u D. Why can't that b enough for u .   I'm SO done with this bullshit. It's probably going to be hard trying to get him out of my life but I'm saving the texts and going to (at least try) get a protective order tomorrow. Thank you all for your comments; they reaffirmed that this behavior is unacceptable. I think I kept adjusting to a  new normal  every time he would do something that was off but not quite bad enough to break up over. We had endless talks about his behavior and he was very good at reassuring me he'd work on it and then being the best boyfriend imaginable. It's like he's two different people but I'm positive the nice side is an absolute lie now after some of the stuff he said. I'm safe for now and definitely won't be going home without an escort.  To answer the questions about why he moved in so quickly: We've been good friends for 5 years and he never once acted like this. I thought I knew him pretty well so that's why I gave him the benefit of the doubt for so long and let him move in. When he proposed it was so romantic and he was so convincing I got a little swept up in the idea that it was real.",1
Dry_Locksmith_4871,I (29M) have fallen in love with a woman (34F) I met online,0,137ybwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/137ybwb/i_29m_have_fallen_in_love_with_a_woman_34f_i_met/,47,2023-05-04 20:06:16,relationships,"but we've not met yet ... and I'm not sure we ever will.  The background is that I broke up with my wife a few months back, after she had an affair. We briefly worked on reconciliation but soon after she announced she was leaving me for her affair partner.  I felt depressed about this and started posting on Reddit infidelity subs (on a different account).  Then, this woman, let's call her Jane, sent me a DM, saying she felt sorry for the way my wife treated me. Jane went on to tell me that she was thinking of leaving her husband, from whom she has started to grow apart.   Jane and I got talking about our respective relationships and we ended up developing a very strong connection. We've been chatting for several hours a day for the last 3-4 weeks. It quickly started to get flirty (edit: I admit, we also sexted) and she kept dropping hints that she's thinking of leaving her husband. We've both confessed that we are starting to develop strong feelings for each other.  Just to be clear - I'm not interested in having an affair, and I don't think she is either. I know too well how shitty it feels to be cheated on; and she doesn't want to inflict that on her husband, whom she still respects, even if she's no longer in love with him   But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't secretly hoping she does end it with her husband so she and I could start seeing each other. Of course, I've not said that to her. On the contrary, I've said she really ought to be doing everything she can to fix her marriage.  But it sounds like she either doesn't want to fix her marriage, or she thinks it's too far gone. I'm not sure to what extent that's because she's developed feelings for me.   Well anyway, one day, she told me she'd had  the talk  with her husband about wanting to end it. However, it sounds like nothing has really changed as a result of that talk. I'm not sure whether that's denial from the husband, or maybe the talk never happened.  She's also said the main reason she's staying with her husband is for financial reasons and because she's worried about the impact that splitting up would have on her kids.   I don't really know what to do now. I like her a lot. I know it's still basically just infatuation at this stage, and may amount to nothing, even if she were single. But my feelings for her are very strong and I can't really get excited about the thought of going out to meet other women right now.  So should I carry on talking to her in the hope she actually does end it with her husband? Or should I actively encourage her to end it with her husband (as she keeps telling me she doesn't love him)? Or should I run a mile at this point? Or something else?  TL;DR I've developed feelings for a woman I met online. She's married but says she's thinking of ending it with her husband. Neither of us wants an affair. I don't know if I should keep talking to her, in the hope she does become single.",1

Me (F21) and boyfriend (M20) have been together long-term and are high school sweethearts. We moved in with each other not too long ago and ever since we have, I've been building up resentment towards him. I mean he still makes me happy and we have fun together but there's these habits that he has that tick me off to no end. His personality is starting to annoy me now. Sometimes he tends to act really wimpy? I don't really know how to describe it. He has these moments where he acts kinda whiny and it's just so unattractive to me but he thinks that I like it.   For example, he'll see that I'm upset about whatever and he'll just kinda pout over me and put on this whiny voice. If we ever get into an argument he shuts down and stews about it for the rest of the day. Then I feel bad and have to comfort him. It's so frustrating.  There's also the factor that has come up recently where I've regretted getting hitched to someone so soon in life rather than experiment more. Lately I find myself thinking about what it would be like to be with other men. Not that my bf doesn't satisfy me. I mean he does but part of me is just so curious to see what I'm missing out on. I like a dominant person in bed and he's not that all. I mean he tries but I can tell it doesn't come easy to him.  And now for this new factor that's come up in the past month. There's this coworker that I've been getting more friendly with and ever since a specific day where a bunch of us co-workers were hanging out - I have been crushing on him so bad. I have not been able to stop thinking about him for the past month and a half. He seems to have everything that my current bf lacks. He's sure of himself and is just so masculine. I feel like he could easily overpower me and throw me around in bed no problem. He's also so much fun to talk to. Talking with him is like a breath of fresh air. We have a similar sense of humor and he really opens up around me - which gives me the idea that the feelings mutual.   I find myself coming up with excuses to see him and even thinking about him when me and the bf are intimate. Sure there's been guys that I find attractive but it never goes further than that. I mean both me and the bf point out to each other people we think are good looking. But this new guy? He has my whole mind wrapped up in him 24/7.  What can I do about this?",1

My boyfriend works two jobs; his leading career already takes him around 50 hours with an enormous amount of take-home work, and the second job takes him around 20 hours. At the same time, I work one job from 9 to 6 and occasionally have take-home work. He's making double the income I'm making.   In our first two years of relationship, I lived in his apartment rent-free (he owns the property), so I usually did almost all the house chores to support him with his busy schedule. I was also the main one doing groceries and cooking as well. He also helped me by sharing the groceries bills and other expenses. One time, I got busy preparing for a job interview and left the floors unclean, so he got upset with me (the interview process is challenging). I wanted this job, and he was the one who encouraged me to give the interview a try.  But over the past year, I rented another room near my office, so it takes me less time to commute. I sometimes sleep over at my boyfriend's place once or twice weekly. He's still working 70 hours or more a week and has no time to clean up after himself, like the dirty dishes sitting in the sink for a week, the apartment floor being dirty, and the bed linen having stayed the same for months. I sometimes find it disgusting to clean these up for him. I suggested he hire a cleaning service, but he refused because he was afraid that the cleaner might steal some valuable items (in some cases, the cleaners steal money or valuable things from the house they come to clean).   Last night he suddenly told me that he felt I no longer love him since I don't care for him like I used to and wanted a breakup if things continue like this (i.e. help him clean the dishes or offer to buy him food when he has instant noodles for dinner). He even tells me about his aunt visiting his apartment and instantly helping him to wash the dirty dishes in the sink, which shows that she cares about him. His reason is that he's been so busy with work that he has no time to sleep, and whenever I visit, he feels like I treat his apartment like a hotel but not my own. I still love him but don't feel I must clean up after his mess when we've lived separately.  Some background on our relationship, we have planned to get married, but due to my boyfriend's tight schedule, we haven't had time to deal with the document. He always offers me a ride whenever I go somewhere alone (of course, only when this is separate from his work or I need to reschedule mine to fit his). He also offers to pay whenever we eat out, even though I suggest splitting. That's why I often order food for him whenever he has overtime work and hasn't eaten anything. My parents are traditional people, so when they found out I'd been living with my boyfriend, they got pretty upset and even had a grudge against my boyfriend, so I offered we live separately before officially getting married so things would ease out between my parents and my boyfriend (I discussed this with my boyfriend already and he seems agreed with this).  TLDR; I used to help my boyfriend with cleaning and chores around the apartment when we lived together, but I don't feel I must continue to clean up his apartment after I moved out. My boyfriend thinks I no longer love him and is considering a breakup. What do you think I should do?",1

She admitted that she didn’t love me anymore and it was best to just end things.   2 weeks before our breakup however, she sent me a little care package and in it she wrote me a letter basically saying how much she loved me. Yesterday she confessed that while writing that letter, she didn’t genuinely mean a single word on there; she wrote it just to make me feel good.   I don’t even wanna look at the letter. She said it’s up to me whether I want to keep it or not.

After i couldn't deny my attraction to him 8 months into our friendship, i confronted him and we decided we just go with the flow.  My mom had just died and didn't think I could handle a relationship because they always felt like a lot of work. But our relationship evolved so naturally and we fell in love, we talk about the possibility of a future together and marriage, and I couldn't be more happy.   I don't know exactly how much he weighs but I would say around 250 lbs (115 kg) for 6  (1.80m), he's is not conveniently attractive but I don't care, I think he's adorable.  I'm overweight too (180 lbs / 83kg) for 5 7 ( 1.75m) but I've always been told that I'm attractive and s*xy and never had trouble getting men to like me.  I was talking to a friend (F) that I haven't spoken to in a while and the conversation went like this :  Her : oh you remember a guy you went out with... Me : actually, I'm in relationship right now, we go to school together Her : oh ! The guy you said was fat and ugly !  Me : he's not ugly, I find him very handsome, plus, we're both fat and we make a cute fat couple. (I tried to joke about it)  I never said that ! I went through our old messages since we had only talked about him once before through text. All I said was that he wasn't my type and send her a picture of him. Never said he was fat nor ugly. I got really mad and told my best friend (F) about this and she said that it was mean and rude.  My best freind knows a lot about him but haven't met him because she lives far.

He's so fat, I didn't realize he was this fat, what the hell did you like about him ?     I got really annoyed, especially that I already told her how rude my other friend's comments were and how I didn't like them.   I'm not planning on our relationship ending anytime soon, I'm very in love with him. But I don't know how to answer these kind of comments.  He's so excited to introduce me to his parents and family. I will introduce him to my family at some point too but after my friends' comments, I'm afraid my family members will not like him or make fun of him because of his size. They are very judgmental and way less accepting then my friends. I know their comments will hurt both of us and i'm afraid that they will make me doubt our relationship.   What should I do ?

I didn't understand why she and Jen became distant after her breakup but I do now. As for the update, I will be not be taking her on the holiday trip. I asked her what was her real intention and it was to get back at her family. I explained to her that it would cause more drama than it is already happening and it's best not to keep in touch anymore. She understood. I bought her a new phone since I noticed her phone screen was cracked. That's the least something I can do for her. Now it's sad that I won't be seeing her family again as they were very lovely to hang out with or at least I thought they were. The friend group Jen and I were in fell apart and I need to get away from all the drama. I feel like starting over since I moved to this city almost three years ago except that I now have trust issues. The good news is, I have spoken to an old coworker of mine about the trip and she excitedly agreed to go with me. Just waiting to see her leave to be approved. That's all.

My girlfriend became bossy and controlling. Anyway, she no longer respect me or our relationship. She would ignore me and act as if she didn't have a boyfriend when other guys were around. She stopped being intimate, no more kisses and stuff , and she always had an excuse for why she couldn't spend time with me. We spend more time talking on the phone than talking in person.  I tried to talk to her about our problems, but she would brush me off and say that she was bad at loving someone. She promised to change, to try learn how to love, but nothing ever changed. I love her deeply, and I don’t want to lose her. She also claims she loves me a lot.  I get jealous sometimes and insecure when I see her giving attention to other guys but not to me. I feel unloved and unwanted, but I cannot leave her. I’m too attached to her, and I don’t wanna let go. I want things to be good between us.  I’m stuck in a cycle of love and heartbreak. I love her deeply, and I know that our relationship is causing me more pain than joy. I don’t know what to do or where to turn. I love her so much that I start to wonder if I am the wrong one. Am I too obsessive or demanding?  I am scared of losing her and being heartbroken.",1

The other girl is engaged to be married soon. And we are actually all friends with her and her fiancé. Recently, we traveled for work and I couldn't help but be bothered by how close the guy I like to the engaged girl and I thought it was too much, I told him that I actually have feelings for him and he was like no worries imma help you out in this and so on. He was clear that he doesn't want a relationship but the heart wants what it wants. I was already going through rough times loosing a loved one and I was craving so much the support from him especially that he faced the same thing at the same time, but we kept on having fights and it's started being cold and hot kinda relationship. I told the other girl that I like him and sense then she has been getting closer and closer to him and even being so physical in front of me. It devastating, especially knowing that she is engaged and I don't understand the situation, we often hangout with her and the fiance and they seem so in love... She keeps on saying things that the guy I like was a bit late cuz he came in into her life after she was engaged, he says that she is exactly like him and he never felt comfortable with someone like that. It burned me inside knowing that they both know I like him. They are now very affectionate to each other, he even send her to hospital when she was sick at work once, goes on drives with her during work, they wake each other up, during work they keep visiting each other..  But on the sideline he keeps talking to me, we even got sexual, and I feel like he is hesitant pulling back and then coming back. To me it hurts so much cuz I like him a lot and I know all those things but can't seem to be able to let go. I stop for weeks then come back to talk to him. The girl is lying to her fiancé about going to events while she is out with the guy I like. But when I talk to her, she keeps on saying how she is excited for the wedding and doing all the preparations, and about to start building her house, am so confused, sad, and depressed! I even started to see a psychiatrist cuz I couldn't handle all the built up emotions. |just keep hoping that if I stick around he will eventually have feelings back, especially that she will be a married woman soon. But I also have the anxiety that she might leave her fiance and be with the guy I like. I really don't know what to do, it's consuming my energy, and I tried so many times to let go but I can't, I even tried to see other guys but he is always on my mind...  How can I get over him? should u still have hope that this might end after the wedding? Should I still hang on to my emotions towards him?",1

Boys that would forget my birthday and only see me after 10pm.   Today, I got flowers from a boy as he sheepishly grinned and told me he picked the happiest looking ones because they reminded him of me.   A boy who looks me in the eyes and says he could look at me forever.   A boy who will make my bed and wash my dishes just because he wants me to have that extra time for myself.   A boy who talks to me about a future together and how excited he is for it. Who is not ashamed to tell his friends about me and wants me to meet his family.   A boy who hugs me tight and wants to do every adventure with me.   A boy who doesn’t hesitate to cuddle me and bring me tea when I’m sick.   A boy who is able to have the hard conversations with me, and tell me that he will fight to make it work, to continue loving me.   A boy who wants to see the world with me.   A boy who loves me at my best and my worst. Who supports my goals and pushes me to reach them.    It’s hard to believe what I accepted before I met this boy.   I love him so much. Sure, we have out disagreements and our annoyances, but through all of that we never stop loving each other.   I’m so excited for what the future holds.",1

About two weeks ago my fiance of five years woke me up to tell me our relationship wasn't working anymore.  We've been living in my parents basement apartment paying $300 each for the past three years while she's been in college. I've been working full time at a local warehouse for the past five years to try to save up enough money so we could eventually move out when she was finished college.  She has bipolar disorder and has been un- medicated for the entire duration of our relationship but has had a lifetime of experience learning to cope with it. I attended sit downs with her psychiatrist with her consent to try to learn how I could be the best support system I could be for her. I became quite intuned with her mood changes and felt like I was very supportive and helpful. Her mother stated I was the best support system she's ever seen in my fiances life.  A week or so before our split I noted that she was in one of the worst lows I had ever seen in her mood before. She would sleep all day, refuse to eat and have zero motivation to do school work or attend class'. I know it's very difficult to get out of that position but I tried to do all I could to encourage her. I know her disorder is not to blame for our split but I feel like the impulsive nature of it may have pushed her further towards her decision.  I know she's been miserable living here for atleast the last year because my mother(62) has boundary issues and a slight drinking problem. She would constantly invade our personal space (Their laundry room can only be accessed through our apartment) as well as constant invasions of our privacy. I tried many times to get my mother to give us more space and privacy but she would always get mad and claim that it was her house at the end of the day.  Four months ago my fiance became friends with an older woman who was going through a divorce and began spending time at their marital house to help shield her friend from her soon to be ex husband. I never had a problem with that but I felt the more time they spent together the more she was becoming jaded with our relationship. She now lives with this woman in a one bedroom apartment down the street from where I live.  We've been in constant communication since our spilt. We've been texting, talking on the phone and have had a lunch 'date' in person. She's told me she's willing to work on our relationship but wants to see me make some positive actions towards moving out of my parents house and also stated she need an unknown amount of time to learn to love herself again. We've both stated that we're still in love with each other but we need to figure our own lives out before we can put ourselves back together.  I really want this work out but I'm afraid that with enough time things will just fall apart permanently and I really don't want that to happen. All in all I'm just here asking if anyone has any advice as I don't really have a good support system in my life at the moment.",1

For a while I thought I would never find someone who “checked all the boxes” and that I had to sacrifice the things important to me for someone. But he is anything I could ever ask for and more.  Yesterday, I worked up the courage to tell him that I love him when we were on a picnic date (I had no real expectation of hearing it in return). I had been feeling this way for the past month, and it grew even stronger when he was across the world on a trip for 3 weeks. Alas, he did not say it back. He was definitely surprised and asked “wait, you love me?” and proceeded to thank me for being so kind but that he was not there yet.   I know he has some deep trauma with an ex who he dated for years and was horrible to him. I know that he is not one to open up like that so easily. But still, I felt humiliated for putting myself out there. He reassured me later that day, when I had to take a beat to process, that I have nothing to be embarrassed about and he’s glad I told him.   I guess what I’m trying to say is that I know he cares for me deeply, I see it in his actions and his care and his attention. I just can’t help but feel sad; I don’t think anyone particularly likes not hearing it back. If anyone has been in a situation like this and has some words of encouragement I would be so grateful.",1

He asked me to be his girlfriend, his friends and family recognize me as his girlfriend, his parents introduce me to people as their son's girlfriend, but I've never heard him say it out loud.   We went to a bar tonight and ran into a coworker of his and he introduced me by saying  This is my girlfriend, Jay  and my heart just melted.

Life just happens in a way you never expect. But, I have also noticed that she’d been enjoying the things she used to less and less. She’s really been struggling with her mental health and while I found her a therapist and encouraged her to see friends and do new things it wasn’t really helping. She’s been unsure of what she wants to do in life, and I’ve just been encouraging her to pursue her interests whatever they may be but even so she’s still just been so sad.   She ended talking to me after the breakup and telling me why she left me, that she’d been putting so much of her own self worth and existence on the fact that I loved her. That she’d been pushing herself to the limit just to try to have me constantly love her so she could feel like she mattered. That despite the fact that I wanted to put her first and to have her focus on herself she never could because she thought she would be letting me down in some way. I think I cried harder than I have in years. While her leaving me is devastating, I also see the woman I fell in love with through the talk. She’s such a fiercely strong and emotionally intelligent person and that she has been able to recognize this and made this decision, even though it was hard for her, makes me so proud. I’m so happy she can take this step for herself and I truly hope she can find herself again, but if the talk was any indication then I think the woman I love will be just fine.   While I am immensely sad that I lost someone I thought I had a forever with, I’d be so much more sad if she stayed with me at her own expense. I think I just love her more for doing this for herself, even if it’s not meant to be for now, or ever. She will always hold such an important place in my heart, she taught me so much and I loved her in every moment. I do hope that I might one day have another chance with her, however, even if not I’ll be okay, just knowing she’s doing better and is happy is more than enough for me.",1

Ever since I've become paralyzed she shows absolutely no interest in me sexually she'll let me do stuff to her when it comes to me she will not do anything and won't really try anything either there's always some sort of excuse. I've tried talking to her on multiple occasions sometimes she just ignores me and walks away other times she will say  maybe if I'm feeling up to it and not too tired  which is understandable but it has now been almost a year and a half since I've even had an orgasm or even been touched. Everytime I try to do things by myself she will get pissed off at me which is a huge turn off for me and considers it  cheating . I have absolutely no privacy and a form of ptsd thinking she's just going to come into the washroom and get pissed at me which stops me from orgasming I don't even know if I'm still capable. She does a lot to help me out otherwise but I no longer feel like this is a relationship anymore it just feels like a patient and caregiver situation now but she also gets very angry easily. Am I being too impatient? I'm paralyzed but I still have needs and I'm still human I just feel like I disgust her now. So I need advice is there any way to fix things? Is my relationship just dead now? Am I living in a fantasy world waiting for something that'll never happen until she breaks up with me and finds someone new? Should I just leave? Am I asking too much?(no there is no other person either I trust her in that aspect)What should I do? Feels like the love is fading away daily  Update: wow a lot of replys sorry I haven't gone through the majority of them I have been rather depressed lately so I've stayed off of everything just trying to keep my head away from bad thoughts.   I think I've decided to just leave she's not the type of person that would do couples therapy and this relationship has been spiralling downward for quite a few years even before my injury there was a lot of problems with no communication on her part only  I don't want to talk right now another time  which would never come or she plays the victim. Her attitude is just getting worse and worse. Too much damage has been done in this relationship to save it.   To answer a few repeat questions I've seen: no it's not caregiver burnout I'm pretty independent the only thing I really need help with is getting on a commode other then that just getting in and out of bed because my side is against a wall otherwise I could do it myself. I have PSW's that come to my house 7 days a week for 2 hour durations. My level of injury is irrelevant as I am trying not to go into too much details I have control of my arms and most of my upper torso so I am independent in that aspect. No I don't believe I am being abused but I do believe she is trying to control me. Even when I try to end the relationship she just walks away and doesn't take me seriously when I'm just trying to discuss how to proceed forward in a civil manner rather then just leaving but at this point I think I just need to leave,1

My parents raised me in a very fundamentalist, christian household and we attended a high control church. While I admittedly had a very comfortable childhood for the most part and enjoyed the benefits of having a greater community around me at all times... this naturally became more difficult to sustain as I matured and began to understand the principles and belief system of the church I was attending and started to feel uncomfortable there. I foolishly leaned into peer pressure about committing to it (the commitment is similar to JW baptism) and became a full fledged member despite my better judgement. 8 years later, I left the group after moving out of my parents house at 26. The church held a meeting to officially chuck me out this past year. Apparently I made it easy for them (apparently) by moving in with my boyfriend of (now) 2.5 years.     Now, my relationship with my parents has always been one marked by authoritarian rule. While my parents were loving, they were not overly affectionate or patiently understanding. I remember my mom used to mock parents who appeared (to her) to be trying to  befriend  their kid, whereas I silently wished my mom wanted to be my friend. I never felt comfortable confiding in them about mistakes and ultimately became a kid who told white lies and constantly hid information to maintain a veneer and I was not good at it. I was very terrified of confrontation, I had abandonment issues and was fearful of not being accepted by my peers. This resulted in me being  difficult  in high school and rebelling against their rules a lot. While my teachers and friends regarded me as someone who was personable and creative, my parents constantly reminded me about how 'contrary' and 'frustrating' i was for them. When I finally moved out of the home at 26 it was met with GREAT resistance. My parents thought i'd end up on a slippery slope to hell and my mom had a full blown tantrum when she discovered I'd secretly moved my essentials out of the house before telling them (this was just in case they decided to lock me out). Eventually they came around to the idea and helped me move in and it was one of my favourite memories. They took me shopping for things and it was one of the few times in our relationship where I felt they supported a decision that I had made.     Despite the little glimmer of hope in helping me move in, the relationship continued to feel strained. They invited me over on a weekly basis for dinner, which 80% of the time I attended. But slowly I could sense the gap in our relationship growing as they started to mount pressure on me about my on/off attendance at their church. When covid hit, all religious services were temporarily suspended and It was actually a chance for me to get some therapy and cut myself off completely (in a psychological sense) from returning to that place. As restrictions lifted, I had made some new friends and re-connected with old school friends which was improving my mental health. I decided to pay a visit to my best friend from school who lived across the country. I asked my parents if they were celebrating thanksgiving and as per usual, they gave a vague and non commital answer so I booked a plane ticket to visit her. At this point I was 29.   That trip I took to see my friend sealed my fate. They were furious I had left without telling them (even though I knew they'd kick up a fuss if I did due to my friend being a 'worldly' person). They proceeded to host thanksgiving without me and from that point onward I have not been invited or included in any family gatherings for 2 years now. Once the church officially shunned me, it managed to get even worse where they wouldn't even keep me up to date with serious news like a family friend dying, or pictures of my new niece. I worked up the courage at one point to tell my dad about my boyfriend and his response was  do you think i'm stupid, of course we know you have a boyfriend. If you think we are going to have anything to do with you dating an unbeliever you can dream on!  and he walked away while I was sobbing and telling him that I was sorry and still loved him and mom. Which makes me cringe considering I was 30 at the time and clearly quite co-dependant and meek.     **TL;DR I'm now turning 32 and my boyfriend and I (he's amazing) are ring shopping. Life feels bittersweet. I am so incredibly happy with my new friends and my partner and the fact that I no longer have this pervasive, almost chronic depression anymore. But on the other side of that joy is a deep pain and vacancy in my heart about not having a mom and dad who even like me, let alone love me.** Things are so bad between us that I doubt they would put aside their pride to help me if I had a health crisis.     Of course, they blame me for the distance despite the fact I have made efforts to reconnect and been angrily shut down. They say I'm willful and rebellious and a 'nightmare' for them and seem to be telling others that its me who abandoned them and went down a morally corrupt route. I've spoken to pastors and ministers who seem uncomfortable and unsupportive of my parents views, I've mostly lost interest in church but attend periodically on holidays. It bothered me today because I heard they were shopping for my siblings birthday and something about that just made me feel really garbage considering they haven't celebrated or acknowledged my birthday in two years, and before that (while things were tense) they stopped gift giving because we were all  too old for that , but now that I'm out of the picture they've picked up those things again and it just f\*cking sucks that's all.",1
ThatWhoWhere,My (20M) girlfriend(20F) fell out of love,6,13g6f2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13g6f2q/my_20m_girlfriend20f_fell_out_of_love/,12,2023-05-13 03:52:32,relationships,"I (20M) was in a 2 years and 4months relationship with my gf (20F). We joined the same two college two years back and currently in our 6th semester out of 8. Two months in beginning of college ironically both of us being introverts we really bonded very well and exchanged numbers start texting on social media and our friendship grew so fast. We used to flirt but in a fun manner and I have no idea how I had the courage to tease/flirt with a friend that is of oppositie gender at that time.  After three months of college beginning she developed feelings for me and I wasnt still aware neither had chance considering me having no luck in my school days. But in few days she kind of confessed but wasnt ready to commit as she had a bad trauma from her school's past. She thought I was a nice guy and was different from rest of the guys she had ever met before where as I was/and still consider myself not so good just a decent guy.  Around December 2020 we were already holding hands sneakily , hugging out were getting all those feelings but had not made it official.   By first week of December we kissed had our first makeout session and then later said we shall considered it as the Day to start dating  Now till here its a happy part, rest 2021 went well  2022 since april we had becomee reallyyyy close to each other to a point we had done quite lot of stuff in college itself. No sex just other intimate stuff. But since Aprill 2022 idk what something happened things began to change, slowly she started saying no to makeouts at time and I was still happy guy in the relationship and thought maybe she is taking tension about future and stuff so needs some time.  Soon our holidays started and around July 2022 she told me something is not right with her. She isnt happy she feels she is not keeping me happy and around May to September our fights had gradually started increasing for whatever stupid reasons.  But I consider myself as one woman man and fights is part of relationships so i never thought of leaving her.  But in September 2022 she told me maybe she has lost feelings for me and all those makeouts in past few months she did with me but dint feel anything. Above that she felt guilty to do this to me and doesnt want to hurt me anymore so confessing it.  I dint understand the meaning of she loves me but she isnt in love with me. So she said she cant be physical with me for sometime and she had proposed a breakup but i couldn't expect to leave her and my tears for the first time in our relationship came out and I wanted to make things right. I said sorry and told will change whatever i felt i am doing wrong. And i did but the fear of losing her had been set in my head.  For a month we dint kiss, until end of October when i asked her if she wants to give it a try and we did a small one and she said she felt fine with it. So I thought things started getting better but our fights were reaching peak of criticizing each other. Maybe we both knew we are not really fightinh just scared to go back to that September moment.  Cut down to 2023 , a week back she said this is it , i can't hurt you anymore.  I am not sexually attracted to you now .  I cannot feel happy being physical with you. And this relationship you are also not happy with and its affecting your(mine) mental health and I still love you but we need to focus on future because right now this has no meaning as we wnat to just stretch it we can but no point of no one is happy .  This time i was somehow more calmer and maybe saw this coming from sometime ago and I dint want to do it but i guess it was for the best.  She says I am the best thing that happened to her and she wants to fall back in love with me again but she doesnt want to feel forced , she wants to feel about it like how she did first time only then if i still interested in her. We would date.  My question is what can I do because we are in same friends group and i still love her and i miss her and i miss everything about her while being in front of her.  But i want to get her back and it drives me crazy as to what should i do. I was really happy and sorted with life before all came to an end like this.   TL;DR : >!My girlfriend (20M) fell out of love with me (20M) after 2 years and she takes the blame for it and calls that i was perfect but she isnt attracted to me anymore sexually but loves me as a  closest friend .And idk how to deal with this as i am one woman man and want her back but in the right way!<",1
Dangerous-Number6761,She (22F) cheated on her boyfriend (23M) with me (21M) and now I'm in love,0,14h1ztz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14h1ztz/she_22f_cheated_on_her_boyfriend_23m_with_me_21m/,18,2023-06-23 15:48:42,relationship_advice,"I have been very close friends with this girl for about 6 years, in fact we lived together in college for our junior and senior year (along with three of our other friends). We would do everything together, we would cook together, do homework together on one of our beds, we'd watch movies, go to restaurants. To any outside observer, it looked like we were basically dating without any of the physical components. We had great chemistry and a very strong connection and my friends would ask if we were together often, but I'd always say no. About halfway through Junior year I realized I had feelings for her and I told her that, but she said she didn't feel the same way about me. I moved on and kept my distance, basically just trying to keep things amicable so there was not drama in our apartment, but we were barely friends (and if we were not living in the same apartment, then I would have stopped speaking to her). I began dating other people in our Junior Spring semester and she seemed really jealous and would often get angry at me for not being a good friend anymore and I told her that she had hurt me and I really just couldn't stay friends with her. But I am an idiot and I let myself get close to her again and one night (the last day of the semester after finals) we got really drunk and cuddled (steamy right? I know...). I almost kissed her, but something in my subconscious just would not let me do it, probably to protect me from getting hurt again. So nothing else happened that night, but the next day, I felt those feelings again. A few days after that, we talked about that night and she said that she was just drunk and lonely and it was a mistake. That hurt, it's not like I wanted to long distance date through the Summer (we were going in different states for our internships), but I guess I just wanted validation that I wasn't crazy about our connection. Anyways, I started to move on and a month later, I met this girl (23F) who was amazing. I fell completely in love in her, but the issue was that she was moving across the country in a month, so I knew it would end in the beginning of August. I completely forgot about my old friend though and we stopped speaking for a while. When we did speak over the phone in the middle of July, she told me she had a boyfriend (23M) and she was really excited about him. I was happy for her since I had genuinely moved on from this girl at this point. She told me that she wasn't sure if she should date him long distance since he lived about 2 hours away from our school's campus, but I told her that if she thinks that he's worth it, then she needs to go for it.  The original girl now had a long-distance boyfriend who would visit every other weekend. I really did not have feelings and I tried to get along with her boyfriend, but we just had clashing personalities, so I completely kept my distance from both of them. In fact, I would avoid her and be kind of rude to her. I did not want to be close to her again, not after being hurt twice. I did not want to catch feelings again. We no longer did anything together like we used to. I barely even acknowledged her anymore. I wasn't bitter (well maybe a little), but I also was just being respectful of her relationship. Remember, me and this girl still live together at this point (since we were stuck in this lease). In October, she begged me to take her to this party I was going to (she did not have many friends and depended on me or our other three friends/roommates to take her places). I hadn't hung out with her all semester so far, so I reluctantly took her. We got very drunk, again, but this time she told me she had feelings for me. They started that night when we almost kissed and she hasn't been able to stop thinking about me. I got really angry. I told her it wasn't fair that she was saying all this now and it certainly wasn't fair that she was saying while she had a boyfriend. I yelled her at for a while until I decided to just go to bed. I spent the rest senior year, incredibly distant and cold to her. I was bitter at this point for all of this. I began to warm up to her (as like acquaintances) at the very end of senior year because she invited me and the rest of our roommates (her boyfriend had work and could not come) to her beach house as a senior week trip and I wanted to keep everything light and fun for the group. (Yes I could have not gone, but it seemed like it would be fun and we were starting to get back to decent terms). One night at her beach house, we all decided to go to one of the local clubs and we had a great time. The other three decided to go home a little early, but me and the girl wanted to stay out a little longer and yep you guessed it. We got a little too drunk. After a while, we began to walk and she stopped me a few minutes from the house and said she needed a break. We sat down on the side of the road and she kissed me. I pulled away and paused for a moment and looked in her the eyes. I kissed her and we lay on the side of that street making out for a while. I honestly don't remember everything going through my head or how long we were there, but I remember what she said. She told me that she loved me and she regretted turning me down a year ago and that she's sorry. Words that I think I had wanted to hear for so long that I started to feel for her again. I eventually stopped us and told her that we need to get home since it was incredibly late at night and we literally on the side of an empty road. We eventually get home (it took a while since we were both struggling to walk), but she starts to puke so I lay her down on the floor and turn her over and then I start to drink water so I can sober up to watch her throughout the night. I was up all night, sobering up and thinking about what had just happened while she was passed out. The next morning, I tell her that we should talk about happened the night before, but she says she didn't remember what happened, so I told her and she froze. She doesn't say anything for a while before I tell her that I think have feelings for her and she tells me that she has feelings too so I tell her that we should probably talk in a couple weeks (this was our last day at the beach house and we were going our separate ways for a month after for various vacations and prior commitments). The next day I get a call from her boyfriend who asked me what happened (she told him that we had kissed), so I tell him and then the next day he breaks up with her. I don't talk to her for a month, but five days ago we finally spoke. She told me that she feelings for me and I told her that I had feelings for her, but she had also been speaking to her (now) ex-boyfriend and she was going to go visit him for this weekend (the first time they will see each other in person since the incident). I told her that I can't date her because I had been hurt by her too many times, so this was our final conversation, I just wanted to say goodbye. We spent that day together talking about us and reminisced before we finally had to say goodbye. That goodbye was very difficult, I know from this reading this story, our past doesn't come off great, but she was very important to me and it was hard to say goodbye forever. We hugged for a while before we just stared each other in the eyes for a couple minutes. Eventually I kissed and we kissed and held each other close for a while before I was finally able to let go and say goodbye. The next morning I woke up and my heart hurt. I missed her so much and I realized that I need to tell her why we should be together before she visits her boyfriend. So I asked to speak with her for 15 minutes and I told her that we have a very unique connection and it would be shame if we never tried dating because it definitely be something special. I told her that if she absolutely does not see dating, then she needs to tell me now because otherwise I will wait for her to see her ex and figure out how she feels about both of us, but I will not be able to wait forever. I gave her a direct out and she didn't take it which either tells me that she is completely torn or she's a coward with no guts for not hurting right then.  &#x200B;  So now she is currently visiting her ex and I told her to reach out whenever she's ready to speak to me again, regardless of the news. Do I even have a chance here? I know a lot of you will say I shouldn't have stayed her friend after the first rejection, but I really did my best to avoid her, it was literally just that we lived together. I know a lot of you will say that she'll do the same thing to me that she did to her ex-boyfriend. But I genuinely believe that me and this girl have a strong and unique connection and I have not had with another girl and I know she feels it too. I'm pretty sure she'll try to get back with her ex because it's the safe and stable choice, but I know that relationship will not work. There were already issues before this, but now there's no trust and he'll always have the upper hand over her. I know I shouldn't feel this way after all the times she's hurt me and frankly I shouldn't wait for her or give her a chance, but my feelings are making insanely irrational right now. I would appreciate any related stories that you guys might have or words that will stop me from picturing what they're doing right now. I have never fought for a girl this hard before and I truly do think she's worth it.  &#x200B;  UPDATE: So not really an update, but thanks to your comments I've gained some clarity. I am actually such an idiot... I can't believe I wasted this much time thinking about this. I am going to move on from her and this whole thing and completely cut contact. Genuinely, thank you for the comments, they really snapped some sense into me.",1
InteractionOk2191,BF(23M) got drunk and cheated on me(21F) with our roommate (21F),115,13xsqnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13xsqnk/bf23m_got_drunk_and_cheated_on_me21f_with_our/,120,2023-06-01 20:41:42,relationships,"TLDR at bottom  Disclaimer: this is a throwRA so they can’t tell it’s me, also it’s written on mobile  I just found out my BF(23M) who we’ll call A, cheated on me (21f) with our roommate (21f) who we’ll call B. He doesn’t know I know, and he just left on a trip for a while and he won’t have his phone except for once every couple of weeks.  To give some background, A and I have been together for a year and a half. We just moved in with our roommate a couple months ago and we have a cat together. Our relationship has been through ups and downs, like every relationship, but nothing terrible until now. Also, he cheated in his precious long term relationship.  B and I have been friends since A and I first started dating. A and I met B on the same day. A always tells me how he has a problem with B and acts like he doesn’t like her when we’re talking about our household.  He keeps a journal that I’ve seen him write in before, and because he has been acting differently and just left for his trip, I decided to read it (don’t crucify me, I know I shouldn’t have). One of the most recent entries states that he cheated with B, and how guilty he feels about it.   What I’m torn about is how much I love him, but hate him right now at the same time. We’re on a lease together, have talked about marriage, kids, finances, and we have a cat together. I don’t want to have to move out of the place I’m living in, but I can’t stand to live with B anymore knowing what I now know. I also don’t know what to do about our cat, either. We both agreed that if we broke up, he would keep her.  I don’t know when exactly he cheated, but I have an idea of when. He wrote that he got drunk and they did it, and I’m pretty sure I was sleeping on the couch when they were getting drunk.  I don’t know exactly what my next moves are. I have a trip planned to visit his mom, and he’s met all of my family and I’ve met all of his. I also want to confront my roommate and my boyfriend, but I don’t know how to go about it without telling them how I found out.  I don’t have any family near me, either, and I can’t easily move out and find another place.   How should I go about confronting them?   TLDR; BF(23M) cheated on me (21F) with our roommate (21F) when they were drunk. Want to confront them but BF is on a trip for a while and won’t have his phone majority of it, plus we have a cat. Can’t move out easily, either.  ETA: For those of you who say he is going to do it again on this trip, there’s nothing more I can say without giving identifiable info other than that we are dual-military, he is in a school, and he is physically unable cheat again while he’s gone.   I’ve talked to him a couple times since I found out, but for now I’m playing dumb. I didn’t mention in the original post but we have another roommate (also 23M) who we’ll call C. Only relevance he really has to this, though, is that he is B’s ex (and yes they both cheated on each other too, crazy, Ik).  I stayed with a friend last night, drank a little bit and played some video games to get my mind off it. For now I’m trying to plan my exit strategy (depending on the outcome of the confrontation) but I am unsure of how long I have because the duration of A’s trip depends on if he passes or fails the tests. It could be 3 weeks, it could be three months.   First thing I’ll be doing is getting screened for std/sti’s. I don’t know if he used a condom or not, but either way I still would get tested.   I wont know the full details of what happened until I confront him, and so I’m also using this time to think of what points to make and if I want to go full scorched earth, tell his family, leadership, friends, etc or if I want to keep it on the DL and have a clean break.  For now I’m ignoring B and C as much as I can and trying to keep busy. I know I haven’t been responding to messages, but trust me I appreciate all that y’all have said and I have been considering it all.    Also I’m definitely canceling the trip to see his mom. I love her so much and it would cause too much pain for me to go.  TLDR: cheater can’t cheat again on trip(I know for a fact), I’m trying to decide what method I should use to confront them, I’m ignoring B and our other roommate C(23M)(B’s ex BF), and I’m taking it one day at a time. I appreciate all the advice <3",1
icanfeelmyface,Edit title: the guy (28m) I’m (29f) exclusively dating is still in love with his ex,1,146aroz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/146aroz/edit_title_the_guy_28m_im_29f_exclusively_dating/,10,2023-06-10 20:52:13,relationship_advice," I knew from the moment we started dating that this guy had built walls around him, but he never shared much about his past. I respected his boundaries and let it go. Everything seemed fine between us. We had a wonderful evening, exchanging heartfelt  I love yous  before he left for his basketball games, as he is a professional player.  Once he left, I found myself alone in his apartment, so I decided to tidy up a bit. As I was cleaning, I noticed a notebook, and a piece of paper fell from it. Curiosity got the better of me, and I picked it up, realizing it was a letter he had written in February 2023. It was written in French and I had ChatGPT translated it for me.  Translation: “When my ex-wife told me, after ten years of marriage, that she no longer loved me, I thought about what love really meant. What is love? Is it a feeling? Is it a commitment? Is it a pill for eternal happiness?  I like to think that love is a choice. You see, we choose people for who they are and for who they are not. We make that choice every day we spend together. So, yes, I admit I still love my ex-wife, and I don't believe I will ever stop loving her. But she is no longer the woman to whom I would choose to offer my love. I truly believe that we should stop thinking that love happens to us in a certain way and that we are powerless to change anything. In fact, I sincerely think that we make the choice.”  Although I'm not entirely sure if my translation is accurate, from what I understood, he still loves his ex but is learning not to give his love to her. Reading those words shattered my heart. My instincts had been telling me that something was off, but I never expected it to be like this—to discover that he still loves his ex and is now consciously choosing not to choose her.  It's all so fresh, having happened less than an hour ago.   Am I just a temporary solution for his broken heart? What role do I play in his life? I thought we were okay. I believed things were working out for us. Now, I feel lost. What should I do next? I don’t want to confront him now and we won’t be seeing each other for the next 3weeks. Should I text him about what I found out? Advice please  Edit: typos. Sorry, I’m using my phone.",1
Ok_Bear_7824,My (38M) sister-in-law (33F) confessed her love to me and is blaming me for it,115,12gbnqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12gbnqn/my_38m_sisterinlaw_33f_confessed_her_love_to_me/,39,2023-04-09 06:56:43,relationships,"My brother Tom (40M) and his wife Jill (33F) have lived overseas for several years and I don’t see them often. Their marriage has been rocky at times and so has my relationship with my brother due to mental health issues on all of our parts.  Last fall Jill came to my country to visit a friend and we met up for dinner. We had a long deep talk and bonded over our shared relationship with Tom and learned a lot about eachother. At the end I told her it was the first time I saw her as a sister and not as just my brother’s wife as we’d never really interacted alone before. Good vibes all around.   All good there or so I thought. Jill and I emailed back and forth a bit in the aftermath. Her emails got gradually longer and more expressive, and I didn’t always respond as I was dealing with some emotional challenges and didn’t have the bandwidth.  But she told me I didn’t have to respond, she just liked communicating with me.  I was grateful to have this window into my brother’s life because I wanted to be closer to him. She confided their relationship was not sexual and more about mutual caretaking now - fine, whatever works.  I just tried to meet her messages with kindness and validation and I know she appreciated it.  Most of the time I just skimmed them and didn’t respond.  Some of them got very deep into her emotional history and it was a lot, but I figured this was just how Jill relates and I didn’t want to discourage her (she is autistic).  And she told me she loved me and cared about me which I thought was sweet.  Well, I should have been paying closer attention because she came back to my country and we set up a visit.  She mentioned she’d be in the area and I told her to come for a few days and I’d take her hiking. Again I thought I would be deepening my sibling-like relationship with her and that it would help me get closer to Tom.  You can see where this is going. She told me two things: 1) I had a history of flirting and projecting sexual energy onto her (this may be true, it’s a pattern I have with women that I’m working on fixing, but it was not something I did consciously nor would act on with her). I was mortified and apologized profusely and said it would never happen again. she said she didn’t mind because…  2) she was completely head over heels in love with me.  Desperately, fully, totally.  Fuck!!  She said Tom knew and they both (wtf??) wanted me and her to be happy together because they weren’t really romantically connected anymore. She said it started when we had that night out last fall.    I don’t think I’ve ever been more shocked in my life.  You could have knocked me out with a feather. On our night out in the fall I was very careful to be respectful of boundaries and I thought we had a beautiful sibling energy between us.  If there was a sexual vibe I certainly wasn’t feeling it at the time but apparently she was!  I told her that I was flattered, but I wasn’t interested as I was trying to get back with my ex and committing to her, I saw Jill as a sister, and I wouldn’t want to be involved with my brother’s wife. And any attraction or sexual energy between us was not intentional and I didn’t want to act on it.  And I wasn’t comfortable with her staying with me anymore so I was going to take her to a hotel (in fact I had already booked a room for on my phone when we took a break in the convo).  She told me it was my fault that she loved me because she was just responding to my advances and mirroring my energy.  When I asked what advances she didn’t have any specific examples.  She tried to persuade me that she knew what I needed and that she could heal my trauma and fix my mental health patterns, as opposed to my ex (whom I love dearly and will marry if things work out).   This really triggered me as I felt she was not listening to me and trying to manipulate me. I told her thanks but no thanks, and we needed to go to the hotel now.  On the way there she had a complete emotional breakdown in my car and was crying hysterically and threatened self-harm so I decided to bring her back to my place and watch over her.  I cooked us dinner and played soft music and put her to bed in the guest room.  The next morning I drove her to the train station ending her trip a day early. Her last words to me were “my offer still stands”.  Now my brother Tom is telling me I created this whole situation as a way to get back at my mother for the emotional wounds from childhood, that I baited Jill into an affair just so I could play power games, deliberately ignoring her emails to destabilize her, and somehow lured her into a trap and coerced her into confessing her love for me so I could reject her and throw her out, and that all Jill’s actions were a natural result of my energetic behaviors.   I’m willing to examine myself for hidden behaviors but this feels Iike a major stretch to me.  Jill is attractive but I DO NOT want to be with her and I was just excited to have a sister. I think maybe Jill was just not used to someone being nice to her and conflated that feeling with love and ran with it.  And I told my brother I can’t be held responsible for her words and actions.   Besides, she told me she was so happy she told me and felt lighter and relieved to have expressed it.    The way I see it, regardless of any feelings or energies between us (and it seems we had very different experiences of those), I kept things above board with my words and actions. She was the one who chose to make an overt move on me which would have broken up my relationship and persisted and argued with me when I turned her down.  As far as I’m concerned I’m done with her and probably Tom too.  But it makes me sad because I was looking forward to being closer to both of them.    Maybe I should have nipped this in the bud when her emails gradually got more intimate but honestly I NEVER thought she was harboring romantic feelings.  Am I losing my fucking mind here?  Please set me straight if it feels like I am missing something from this situation.  What, if anything, can be done to repair this?    TL;DR: visit with sister in law goes south when she confesses her love, now she and my brother blame me for creating the situation, is it really my fault?",1
ashers_olives,Yesterday was my dad's birthday and the family reunion gave me some time to re-examine romantic and familial love.,9,1467ytn,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1467ytn/yesterday_was_my_dads_birthday_and_the_family/,4,2023-06-10 18:52:13,love,"Some days, reunions feel so bland. There's this inner obligation to ask each other on how they're doing and share opinions and impart some helpful wisdom while struggling to bridge that emotional gap. Would I say it's love when you want the best for each other or is it just some social sense of duty? Either way, how well it goes tends to depend on each person.  They always ask me,  Do you have a girlfriend *yet*? , like it's been something I lacked. As for my brother, it was something along the lines of  *How many* has he had now?  Both are questions that I feel are lined with judgement. Are all families like this? I tend to wonder as I feel little loving concern and more discomfort-motivated criticism. In any case, I'm not the most eloquent speaker as to keep their attention when I rationalize my romantic or relational choices. I just don't want to get into relationships I know would fail, you know? It's too much responsibility.  I've always enjoyed the company of others and was satisfied with friends of both sexes. If I find a certain someone attractive, I try a little harder. I ask or figure out if they're single or interested. I get involved. I check to see if anyone else is interested. If I try and things don't work out, I try not to get too disappointed. It's been this way for me for years. Yes, I overthink, but who doesn't when they have something or someone they care so much for?  It's in these times that I tend to reflect on my past relationships and why they didn't work out.   * My first, which not many in my family know, was wonderful. She was honest and brave. But her heart had borne quite a burden. She saw so little in herself when I saw so much. In the end, she chose herself over us and I can respect that.  * My second love was regretful because of waiting on the first. I didn't even get to confess.  * My third was far away. Our words were not few but our moments together were. In the end, someone closer when I was far took her heart. They had a child in a moment of passion.  * The fourth came but her thoughts lingered on another like how I did with my first, so I gave her time but fate parted us just when my feelings started to grow.  * The fifth was endearing but we only knew each other behind screens and pictures. Reality was disappointing so it was the only time I was the one who initiated to part ways. I tried but I knew not to force my heart for what it did not feel.  In the end, only once did I confess, to the first that saw little in me and little in herself. It was a yes that felt rushed and unreal, met with an vague degrading no. I couldn't win, a man against depression. But true love would choose her healing. The fifth came close, but that was all it was. No question was asked but it was felt. She loved every moment and I felt valued, but why could I not feel the same love? My thoughts come with a quick answer to which I'm saddened with how superficial in reality I can be.  Did I make the right decisions? Do they deserve the weight of regret? Reunions really make me feel inadequate. That's why I tend to stay silent and eat on these moments.",1
Lucif3rMorningstar0,My GF(18F) loves clubbing and I(20M) Feel bad when she does it.,0,13x1b9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13x1b9b/my_gf18f_loves_clubbing_and_i20m_feel_bad_when/,28,2023-05-31 23:11:11,relationships,"Hi there! Well, Me and my gf  have been in a formal Relationship for 7 months aprox. We have a beautiful relationship, treat each other with huge respect and even though we have our drawbacks, we are able to understand us in every situation no matter what it is.   When I first met her, I knew that she liked night life, mostly going out clubbing and dance with friends.(which is completely understandable because she is just 18 y.o). Moreover, I had the opportunity to enjoy with her and her friends(mostly women) some nights out. The thing here is that I'm not that kind of person who enjoys clubs and those types of enviroment. I get bored easily and rarely feel comfortable on the dance floor, but I would go because I wanted to spend time with her and see how she and her friends act when she go out, to feel secure about what we were building.      Nowadays we are well established luckily, and of course, She still partying some nights. In contrast, I'm in a period of my life when the last place I want to put a foot in is a club, therefore I don't go with her. This make me feel extremely uncomfortable and I feel the worst when these nights arrive, because I stay at home, she goes out and my head start to moving to the worst places ever seen, making me cry, overthink, feel insecure, betrayed, bad and other awful feelings(Although I have no reason to feeling so because she always shows me pure loyalty), resulting in me the next day treating her coldly and not wanting to continue with what we have. The worst thing is that I don't even know where these feelings comes from. I don't know how to recognize and treat them. Besides, I don't tend to talk about this situation with her, mostly because I'm scared of the result of that talk.     I see no escape from this without prohibitions, toxic behaviours and self-drestuction( for both of us). Even we had a little fight last time she went out because I felt insecure and extremely bad about it. She's partying next Friday with friends and already now I'm feeling bad, upset and insecure. I truly try to be ok with it but I just can't and I don't know what to do with me, her or our relationship.     I would love your advices and some kind of guide of what would you do being on my shoes. Should I work with my feelings? Should I left her because I feel whe are not compatible on that topic? Help pls.     TLDR: My GF loves clubbing and I don't. She every now and then goes out and I feel extremely bad when she does it, even though I have no reason at all to be so. What should I do with these Encountered kind of personalities?",1
Difficult-Goal4266,"I [24M] Think I Am Falling Out Of Love With My Girlfriend [24F] Since High School? Not Sure If We Should Stay Together, Or Have We Grown Apart?",3,14fawii,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14fawii/i_24m_think_i_am_falling_out_of_love_with_my/,10,2023-06-21 15:33:13,relationship_advice,"This is, obviously, not a post I want to make. I have been dating my current girlfriend since the Summer between 9th and 10th grade. Almost ever since we've been dating, we have been the couple that has had the rock steady relationship that is the envy of all of our friends and, to a certain extent, even family members like siblings. We have done pretty much everything together, to the point where most people we know in our personal lives think of both of us when they think of one of us.  She is an absolute treasure of a human being. To be perfectly honest, she is a much better person than I am. Aside from little high school drama when we first started dating, we've never really had a major spat between us. She has been as loyal as anyone can reasonably ask for: I am someone who, ever since childhood, has had numerous health problems that I won't delve into for the sake of keeping this post coherent. But regardless, she has stuck by me through all of the bad, and has made the good even better. She is extremely caring, thoughtful, supportive, and absolutely full of love. To say that I am her world would hardly be an understatement.  Which is why this post hurts me to make. I think I'm falling out of love with her.  A friend once told me years ago,  you never know a person for real until you move in with them.  And I am starting to figure this out. While she has all of the above-mentioned good qualities that I love, I have been having trouble seeing some of her habits as being ones that I want in a long-term partner. In fact, I would call it an almost parent-child relationship that we have ever since moving in together.  Some backstory: through the kindness of my parents, we had a sort of  trial moving in period  while we build our savings, credit, and job history for an apartment of our own. This lasted for about 6 months, until the two of us got COVID, and she went back to live with her parents (I am immunosuppressed, so having her around would not have been safe for me). Through living with her, I came to find out that she is very lazy with household chores, errands, and other adult responsibilities. I find that, on top of being the majority income earner and paying the majority of our rent, I was also solely tasked with cleaning, cooking, and running errands. She leaves everywhere she goes very messy, like a tornado blew in, and I found myself always having to clean up after her. Essentially, I feel like I was made to put a disproportionate amount of effort into our partnership, on top of having a stressful job and physical and mental ailments of my own. And when she did handle these responsibilities, it wasn't without me practically begging for her to simply chip in here and there, even though she gets home from work an hour earlier than me. She is overall very much mentally and emotionally still a child. This also caused a rift between her, my parents, and myself. They see it as disrespectful that they would allow her to live under their roof to help me build a life with her, and she contributes essentially nothing to the household, and I very often have to bear the brunt of both their concerns and complaints about her behavior as well as her concerns about my parents being overbearing. I'm basically made to be the middleman that both of them vent to. Which I am willing to take, but I think is unfair to me as I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression disorders. I think their dynamic may even play a part into why it has been so bad lately.  She has also let herself go since we met: she has gained a significant amount of weight, to the point where she is medically obese. I still love her, because her looks are only part of what made me romantically attracted to her in the first place, and I understand that people's bodies change as we age: metabolism slows down, women in particular have hormonal changes that make them store fat more fat than men and in places they might rather not, etc. But growing up alone is not responsible for someone going from a healthy weight range to an unhealthy one. It's also unhealthy for me by proxy. It has been highly recommended by my doctors to exercise and eat healthy, and her lack of effort on both ends makes it hard for me to stay motivated. If I'm being honest, the weight gain along with the above-mentioned immaturity is making me lose my physical and emotional attraction to her. Pardon the phrasing, but we went from humping like jackrabbits to hardly having sex at all. I'm sure that is normal with long-term relationships, but there seems to be a bigger issue at hand related to it.  I used to want to see her all the time. I used to miss her when she wasn't with me, when I was at school or work, or during the week when we wouldn't see each other before we moved in. But lately, even though she is moved out, when she does come to be with me, I feel almost annoyed. I feel like I'm spending time with her because I'm obligated to, and not necessarily because I want to. The same goes for texting with her, or calling her. Now that time has passed, my parents have offered to try allowing her into our home again when and if she is ready (again, they are extremely generous), but my girlfriend has so far refused to take them up on their offer. This shows to me that maybe she isn't as serious about us as and committed to our relationship as I once thought. And to be honest, I'm not exactly rushing her back at this point. I honestly prefer my time without her here. And I genuinely worry, if things were that bad when she was living here, no matter how many conversations we had, things will only be worse when we move in. For example, she is not good with finances or numbers in general, so I will most likely have to take care of all of the bill paying and tax paperwork, on top of the household responsibilities and being the majority income earner. Overall, I feel very drained, and emotionally checked out of our relationship. Like I've outgrown it. I want to be an adult, and start a life for myself, and it feels like she isn't ready for that.  This is all very confusing. Because I do have love for her. It might be because it's the only life I really know, but I have a hard time seeing a life without her. And, when we were children living carefree in this world, there was nothing I wanted more than to be with her. Unfortunately, now that  real life  has kicked in, I am having trouble with seeing her as someone I want for the long haul as things currently are. We have had conversations about most of the above topics (minus letting herself go, I would never bring that up to her, though nutrition and exercise has come into a conversation for my own sake), and through what feels like a million promises, nothing has changed. At times, I feel like I am continuing our relationship more out of a self-imposed sunken-cost obligation to myself and her than because I actually want to. And, selfishly, there is a subconscious part of me that feels that I can't do better. She also has mental health issues of her own that, while treated and doing well for a while, have been creeping up recently, and I would feel an immense level of guilt breaking up with her. This truly feels like a lose/lose scenario for me. I have been trying to focus more on myself, and distance myself from her inch by inch. But she is picking up on it and asking me what's wrong. I lie, for her sake, and tell her that everything is fine, that I'm just busy, that I would love to hang out when we can. And I am realizing as I type this, that even though it's what she wants to hear, it isn't what she needs to hear, and it isn't fair to her for me to lie to her even if it comes from a good place.  TL:Dr; I am losing romantic feelings for my long-term high school sweetheart, and it has been a gut-wrenching experience for me and, I'm sure, her as well. I don't know if this is something that can be changed, or is fair to ask her to change, and am at a point where I am uncertain if I should end the relationship or stay in it even though I'm not currently happy.",1

So, in the meantime you don’t feel compatible with anyone else that shows interest in you because 1) you know you would just be leading them on or 2) you’ll just keep searching in them for the traits the off-limits person has, or 3) your attraction to the off-limits person grows even stronger by contrast because it turns out you and the new person have nothing in common.

Our relationship had its upside and downs but she was my person. I'm not a perfect person, I made major mistakes as I grew with her. I believe that love is not something butterflies and great sex. Love is about being with people we can be ourselves and they can be themself. Love is about listening and being listened to. It's about sharing the joy and pain of life. I loved her at her worst, I love her flaws. I know, I can't solve her problems but life is a journey and we all need a buddy. She has a major trauma since 2020 due to her father's fatal car accident. Her father's death changed her, broke her. After 3 years, she is still in pain, my heart still aches for her since 2020. She doesn't know but I currently follow her legal case by a courtesy of my lawyer friend.  During 2020-2022, I tried to be there for her, I was her rock (this is what she said). Since then, our relationship took a sharp turn, one-sided, I was the caregiver and she didn't put any effort for our relationship due to her depression. I was like her absent mother for 2 years. And we were like  flatmates .  On May 2022, she had a chance to excel in her career and moved to Europe. I supported her decision, very happy for her. But due to the long distance, I was very tired because the compassion and love were minimum, still she didn't put any effort to love or support my mental health (I've learnt I was adopted after 32 years and the depression hit hard). She doesn't care because my adoptees love me. I still don't understand she didn't have any compassion for me.  On October 2022, she broke up with me after 15 days of our wedding. She wanted to be friends, I accepted because of hope. Maybe someday, she'll change her mind and understand what we had was unique bond.  Months later after breakup on March 2023, I've learnt I had a cancer right in front of her and she treated me very badly during these days. I think she hates me or maybe she never loved me almost for 2-3 years. She emotinally and mentally checked out from the relationship in 2020. I really don't know how to read her behaviors. She acted like she's sick of me and never cared about me. I think she doesn't want to deal with all. I was so scared, I was alone. She said I'm her ex, so I didn't have a right to get a support from her like we're lovers. There is no compassion, that's why I think she hates me. I really don't understand how she could be so cold and heartless. This broke me, humanly as possible. I can't describe how I felt. I was crying because of her right before my operation, I was crying second day after surgery at the hospital.  Cancer drastically changed my point view of relationships. After all, in the end all we have is connections, compassion and each other. So, I swallowed my pride, because my love for her is profound. If she could tell the patterns of her behavior, maybe I would understand... You can call me dumb, loser or idiot. Maybe I am, maybe I am not.  Last month, she said she didn't love me anymore. So the hope is gone. And that was it. All I need to hear was this phrase. I stopped making excuses for her behavior after she said it. I'm now sure she hates me. And It's okay. I can now see clearly that during our friendship she gaslighted me and manipulated me in different situations, so she can get my attention, love and approval until she found someone on May 2023.  She wants to try another journey, hope she will find peace within herself. I'm very happy that she's in therapy. I wish her my best, hope she will never regret of her choices.  I hope will not break my no contact, it is very hard. I can only love her in silence from a distance. I hope, I can heal from all this. Do you have any tips for not breaking no contact? Anyone has a similar traumatic break up experience, please share your self healing journey!  PS: English is not my native language, sorry if there are some grammatical mistakes.  TLDR: My wife dumped me after 15 days of our marriage. I hope to get back together for months, remained friends.. I started to no contact after she said she didn't love me. It was a traumatic breakup experience. I have cancer, I'm struggling. Do you have any tips for not breaking no contact?

As their birthday is today, a weekday, when we both have work, we went to Disneyland last weekend to celebrate their birthday.  I gave them their gifts and we had a wonderful time.  This week begins and I am greeted with a lot of stress regarding work, unexpected bills among other things. I was absolutely exhausted last night and went to bed early.  The next morning on the 22nd: I always call my partner for 10 minutes before work begins. During that morning phone call it did not cross my mind that today was the 22nd, their birthday. Five minutes into the phone call, my partner said they were disappointed with me and it's like I don't care about them anymore. I was confused as to what they meant and where all of this was coming from. I apologised and asked them if they could elaborate on what I might have done to upset them. They did not explain their reasons for being upset and the phone call ended.  Immediately after it ended I saw the date on my phone and it clicked. Today is the 22nd! So I messaged them saying sorry and of course wished them a happy birthday. I have had no reply so far.  I feel very bad for not realising the date. Is there anything else I can do to make it up to them? I'm concerned I may have ruined their day, or have made them very unhappy. I really don't want them to feel down because of me.

I need to vent and hear some advice. I hope someone reads this - and there’s a TL;DR at the end ✨  I’m from Brazil and went on a trip to France to visit part of my family that lives there.  I met this guy (24M) on Tinder even before I traveled, and we kept talking frequently for about 2 months. We met in January, and I (22F) went on my trip in March, but we only started going out in April. I came back to Brazil on May 1st.  During that month together, we fell for each other. The first date was really nice, and by the end of it, he had already planned our second date - which was a city tour of the city he lives. He had prepared an entire itinerary and said he wanted to impress me 🥺 (he succeeded). We only had sex on the third date, and it was great, especially for him lol. It's amazing how Brazilian women really have a different way with foreigners.  On the fourth date, he said he was in love and told me that he ended a relationship three years ago and had never felt this way since then. He also mentioned me to his mom and friends.  Anyway, all the time we spent together was great, and on my last day, he even met my family (part of my family lives in his country, and the other part had traveled with me). We spent that last day together, he cried, gave me a book with a dedicatory as a gift, and in the end, he stayed with me at the airport from midnight until 5 am, waiting for my flight.  BUT after I returned to Brazil, we spent a week talking every day, and then, naturally, we drifted apart. I had expected this to happen, but I didn't expect to feel this way. I've never felt the way I feel about this guy, and the distance plus the sudden cutoff of contact with him has been really hard on me, even physically, you know? I feel nauseous very often, and I can't concentrate on daily activities. Working, for example, has become an enormous challenge, unlike anything before.  He's considering coming to visit Brazil in February, but that's a long time, and so many things can happen until then - I know he’s moving on with his life and even following new girls on Instagram 😅 (which is ok obviously since we’re not exclusive and 9000kms apart. But it’s hurtful anyway lol). Time is passing extremely slowly for me.  After a few days of distance, I sent a message saying I missed him, and his response was that he missed me too but was avoiding to text me because the distance is too painful. It's been almost a week, and we haven't talked much, but we scheduled a FaceTime on Saturday.  All I can think about is going back there, but it's a bit expensive and difficult to get a visa to live in France as a Brazilian. And I also don't know if we would still work out if I were to go there, you know? We're very young and from different cultures. Who knows? Maybe we fell for each other precisely because the time was short, and with more time, we would discover it wasn't like that at all?  I don’t know if I should talk about all of these feelings with him on Saturday or if it is too much. What do you guys think?  Anyway, I don't know what kind of advice I'm seeking, but I know I need some 🥲  TL;DR: Met a French guy but I’m Brazilian. We had an amazing month together, but now we're apart. The distance is messing me up physically and emotionally. Thinking about going back, but it's pricey and complicated. Not sure if we'd still work out with more time. Need advice, feeling lost.",1

I never felt emotions like I had with her and us breaking up was (and still is) one of the worst things that has ever happened to me.  She taught me what love means and now that I don't have her anymore I really miss it. I miss the feeling of holding someone in your arms and never wanting to let them go, the feeling of true selfless love. Long story short, being single is fairly depressing.  I hear advice from people all the time.  Work on yourself!   Delve into your hobbies . And I have been doing that, but I just feel so empty. Now that I know what love means I want it back more than ever, but I can't help but think this is unhealthy. I want to learn how to be okay with myself and not having to rely on romantic love to make me feel happy. I guess you could say that I'm a codependent.

I have a girlfriend, we started dating 2 years ago. She is great and I love her. We are in a LDR but we make it work. It is my healthiest and loving relationship ever. I am going to visit our home country next month.   However, I have this childhood friend (26M), who I have been friends with since we were in grade school. When I moved to a different country we continued to communicate through messenger. We also saw each other when I went home last 2017. Around that time, after I came back here, he started flirting with me. At first I thought it was just a joke because we joke about things like that all the time. But around 2019, he confessed that he likes me. Comes 2020 and we started flirting for a month or two. When he asked me to be his gf I got scared that it’ll ruin our friendship. I was also so stressed out with school that time because of covid. So, I ended up rejecting him. We kinda stopped talking except greeting each other on holidays and birthdays.   Because I am coming home, I reconnected with some of our friends and they mentioned him and asked me if it’s going to be awkward. He is not in a relationship and my friends were joking that he’s waiting for me, which he used to say a lot before.

I love her and we already have plans for our future. We like the same things and our personalities kind of matches. I am afraid that if I bring this up with her, she’s going to break up with me.

throwaway--goose,How do you begin to end an engagement when you both live together and the other party is very much still in love?,389,13yqbqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13yqbqw/how_do_you_begin_to_end_an_engagement_when_you/,123,2023-06-02 21:42:33,relationships,"I (26F) started having second thoughts about this relationship last September. We had gotten engaged a few months previous. We are just over 5 years together.  To summarise, the doubt started because my fiancé (27M) spent a lot of time gaming (a few hours most evenings and weekends), wasn't pulling his weight with cleaning/planning/decisions etc, didn't really make an effort with me and I generally felt a bit neglected/taken for granted. We both work full time but I was doing most of the housework and made dinner the majority of the time. I voiced all these things as they were happening (please do the dishes, please take your cups/dishes out to the sink when you're done, please clean the bathroom, can we spend some time together on the couch etc), we had discussions on being more equal with chores and spending more time together, but eventually I gave up and started pulling away because I didn't feel I was being listened to.  We had taken steps to start looking at buying a house together shortly before I started pulling away, and only when I said I was reconsidering did he start to listen and make an effort. In his defence, he has made an effort for the last few months - he does the dishes when it's his turn, he's better with laundry, spends a bit less time gaming (we're still in the hours a day range but would come out now if I asked, but I don't want to spend time with him anymore but will go into that in more detail below), has made an effort to hug/kiss me more.  My problem is that his effort hasn't really changed how I feel. I think by the time I gave up asking and started pulling away, it was too late. I'm very aware of the fact that it took me saying I didn't want to go forward with buying a house for him to actually listen to me, and I'm worried he'll go back to his old/natural level of effort if we do go forward with the house.  I don't feel attracted to him anymore, I used to find him cute but I don't now. He talks a lot, and I used to like it because I'm quiet and it was nice to have someone who was chatty, but it annoys me now, and I feel horrible saying that. I don't get excited about the things he's clearly very excited about and I feel bad for not being enthusiastic for him. He's been away a few times in the last few months and it was so nice to have the house to myself. Each time I was looking forward to him leaving and sort of deflated when he'd come back. Dreading is too strong a word but definitely that sort of sentiment. I'm happier spending time alone, if he comes out from games or wants to go somewhere I had been planning on going alone I'm almost disappointed. Any time buying a house together or getting married or even as much as going on holiday together gets brought up (either by him or by friends/relatives) it puts a pit in my stomach.  TL;DR: I am no longer in love with my fiance even after he has made an effort to improve and think it's time to end the relationship. We live together, my family thinks he's great, he is a good man, we have some shared hobbies and some separate ones too, and on the outside we look like a great match. The main things I'm worried about are:  1. He very clearly still loves me and is very much attracted to me. I care about him and do not want to break his heart, although I know breaking up with him will. Is there anything I could do at all to lessen the blow?  2. How do you separate your lives when you live together and have been together so long? We have a lot of memories together, I love his friends but I've accepted I'm going to lose them (which is completely fair). We live in my home town, a few hours away from his home town, and rent is very expensive if you're on your own. I could move back with my parents but he would either have to pay extortionate rent or move home (which I know he would struggle with, he struggles living with his family for more than a few days) or move much further out of the city.  3. This might sound ridiculous given all of the above but is there any way of knowing if this is the right decision? I could deal with still being single in a few years if I knew even on bad mental health days that it was the right decision to make, but if I was miserable and single because I believed I had made the wrong decision I'm not sure how I'd live with it. And I know it's all about finding your own happiness etc but I'm more so worried I'll suddenly realise I was just being too hard on him and should have worked harder to fall in love again.  I have spoken to a virtual therapist about all of this but it hasn't really cleared anything up for me. I'm in the process of finding an in-person therapist to speak to. Any advice or even stories (either way - left or stayed and happy, left or stayed and unhappy etc) would really help me out. Thanks for reading if you got this far.",1

Hes had multiple girlfriends in between and it’s been fine. I’ve never had a bf if that matters. About a year ago I noticed it was just constant sexual tension with us. It all came to a head when we were drinking one night and we had sex. It was really good but we never really talked or dwelled on it. We were both single.  So now he’s had a gf for some months and we were hanging out a couple nights ago and we ended up kissing and had sex, and basically said we loved each other. I told him I want to be with him.   I really do want to be with him. I’m just scared I don’t know how to do this relationship thing right and I’m gonna fuck it up somehow and I won’t have my friend anymore.  The problem is that he has a girlfriend… me and her have never met, and she was texting him like crazy. This also makes me feel scared about it, because he cheated. He has never cheated or done something like this before. Even when he had a gf before it never went this far ever.   I would love some advice on this situation and maybe some insight to explain how possibly he feels, and how I shouldn’t go about it.  Tl;dr: I have sex with my bestfriend. He has a gf.

mqhler,[HELP] Two extra stanzas on top of Blake's The Garden of Love?,4,14a87j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/14a87j3/help_two_extra_stanzas_on_top_of_blakes_the/,2,2023-06-15 17:25:35,Poetry,"Just wondering why some versions of the Garden of Love have five stanzas. I've seen two versions, one of which has an extra two stanzas at the top, though the more popularly posted version seems to be the regular (also the one I was also introduced to first), three stanzas.   It does seem that the two stanzas placed on top are actually from another early Blake poem 'I laid  me down upon a bank' so the three stanza version is definitely the actual version, but is there a reason why people have posted the poem online with another on top? Did one person make a mistake and others just copied or do they actually go together (though, of course, they weren't published together)? I've pasted the (seemingly incorrect) poem below.  Thanks!     **The Garden of Love by William Blake:**  I laid me down upon a bank,   Where Love lay sleeping;   I heard among the rushes dank   Weeping, weeping.  Then I went to the heath and the wild,   To the thistles and thorns of the waste;   And they told me how they were beguiled,   Driven out, and compelled to the chaste.  I went to the Garden of Love,   And saw what I never had seen;   A Chapel was built in the midst,   Where I used to play on the green.  And the gates of this Chapel were shut   And  Thou shalt not,  writ over the door;   So I turned to the Garden of Love   That so many sweet flowers bore.  And I saw it was filled with graves,   And tombstones where flowers should be;   And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,   And binding with briars my joys and desires.",1

That’s all great, but then he started asking me why I don’t do any of those things.

Would appreciate your insights on this.   I ( F27) met a guy ( M27) and known him for 5 years. Then he proposed us to be in a FWB situation since he isn't ready to commit. We haven't been physically intimate yet but we act as if we are in a relationship basically doing everything couples do in relationships but so far without the physical intimacy ( so far no kissing anything and we never said I love you; we just goood friends )    I'm very confused as to whether he loves me or not.   When I am sick he makes sure I'm okay and goes extra mile checking on me every hour, he insists we say goodmorning and goodnight everyday, we talk everyday and he tells me all the details of his day, and he is very honest about things ( well even the fact that he doesnt feel like commiting) , he acts like my bf, would send me cute photos that I like, would wish me HB at midnight, would include me in all decisions in his life; whether it is what vitamin he should take or big professional decisions as to whether he should go in a business or not.    He actively listens to me, values my advice, my insights and holds my opinion on things at the top. He integrates me in every part of his life, make me meet his family, always never hesitate to help me, texts me instantly and fast always, always make time everyday to take to me before bed, whenever I need moral support he would leave all his work to come support me. He has reassured me telling me that he cares for me, wants me as his friend for life, that he appreciate me as a person and is lucky to have me around in his life.   He told me that we are a team, we have such great emotional bonding, he likes that I care for him and that I understand him like no one before. He has given me many business deals, offered advise and said that I will never lose with him and he will always help and support me. Whenever he gets angry in fights( yeah we fight like couples where he gets jealous ) he usually listens to me afterwards and has actively work on bettering himself.   Well but when we talked about sex, it's where things gets confusing; he one day would talk about making love then the other says that we would just be fucking for fun, and no strings attached and that he just wanna have a good time and doesn't wanna commit.   So I'm confused. I mean is it possible that he loves me but he wants something casual with me? But then sometimes the way he talks about sex seems more like a casual physical thing only. I'm very confused.   I love this guy and it would mean if he loves me tooo but I don't know. Should I take his words at face value that he doesnt want a relationship and just casual fun sex or believe his caring actions?  tl;dr : Close friend proposes a Fwb situation and acts like he is in a  real relationship.

I live in country X, and she also used to live here but moved to country Y for her masters and will graduate this year. After the party we started texting a lot, which then turned into hours of video calling and talking about all kinds of stuff.   We had an idea to go on a trip abroad  together. I haven't seen her since December and last week we finally went on the trip. I really like her but wasn't sure about her feelings and went there with no expectations. I have to say it was one of the best experiences in my life - we had an amazing time together, almost had no time to sleep from all the stuff we did and all the long conversations. Also things happened naturally and we got intimate.   We discussed that we're having a great time together, and she said that she's not really interested in a long distance relationship, and I said I'm also not sure about it. She also said that she doesn't know what she's doing after her studies or if she is willing to return to country X. I totally understand because she is 22 and wants to enjoy her current lifestyle before settling down.   She also said she wants me to visit her again and enjoy our time together. I thought I would just move on without thinking too much about it and of course still keep in touch and plan to see each other again. However I'm pretty sure I'm seriously falling in love and I am actually willing to commit to a relationship with her. So I don't know what to do now. She is only an hour flight away, so I think long distance would work just fine while she decides what and where to do next. I also want to mention that I've had multiple long term relationships before, also a long distance one, and I've never been so in love and felt so perfectly aligned with someone.  I am trying to figure out whether I should I talk with her about my feelings and ask her why she doesn't want a LDR or if she's willing to try it out?

We met and started talking in school about 4-5 months ago, and I'm taking her to prom this Thursday. I originally decided a while back that I'd just ask her to prom as friends because I thought she was really damn cute and she also was sooo cool, we had so many things in common and she had an awesome personality. The issue is that I'm convinced we both have caught feels (I have hard). Especially this past month I've really been talking and only thinking of her. In terms of how she feels, it's hard to tell because she is quite reserved and wont tell much to my friends because she knows they'll tell me, but she is for sure showing signs of interest. The real issue here comes in 2 parts. 1. I am leaving in about a month to university, and even if you make it 3 months with the summer is it worth to spend our time together falling in love just to leave heartbroken. 2. Even if I were to pursue a long term relationship with her a HUGE issue is that her parents are strictly religious, and have very specific restriction for a boyfriend. Even though I may pass as I follow a similar religion (not strictly), I still don't really fit her parent's cultural requests. That being said, I still really really love here and I've spent the past week thinking about us non-stop. I don't know whether I should keep my distance especially after prom so that we don't catch feels too hard and end up hurting each other, but on the other hand I really wanna spend this last month with her as much as possible, and since her birthday is on June 29th (literally day before school ends) I want to give her a gift and confess everything to let her know in case things don't really workout. What do you think I should do?  TL;DR I'm in love with this girl a year younger than me and I'm leaving, do i try to continue a relationship despite her parents being strict or do i have fun and let it go?",1

I've tried to explain how much I love her and her body and that I'll be there for her in every way possible throughout this journey, but it seems she thinks I'm just saying this to make her feel better.

(23m&55m)  Before I get into it, I hope you can upvote and comment so hopefully you guys will help me make up my mind...So here is some info before I get into it,, I 23 male and my partner 55male have been dating for 2 years now, we have had our ups and downs, times when we took breaks etc...and not to forget to mention: 1-we are from a third world country in which homosexuality is a sin and you can even get punished by law! .. 2- my partner is mostly straight! He had been with guys when he was younger, but he described it as just being very young and horny! I'm basically the first guy he has ever dated... despite him almost being straight he started making moves on me as we were just friends before etc.. 3- he had truly fallen in love with a girl 5-6 years ago,he was mad about her and they dated until 4 years ago ,, thats when few months before their wedding he found out she is cheating on him... It made him depressed, lost his job etc...  About one year and half afterwards we met and became friends... After 6 months I could tell that he was into me and was obviously flirting with me, It was not long till we started dating... For the past 2 years I have been waiting for him to say 3 simple words... Which is ( I love you)! Even tho I remind him and tell him I love him on daily bases, or sometimes call him just to hear his voice,, I have been trying my absolute best to help and fix the damage she had done to him. I have surely seen improvement but to be honest it's becoming tiring! Constantly and unconditionally showing love and not receiving much in return. Even when I say ( I love you) , he either says thank you or laughs and says (and I hate you) anyhow I understand it's hard for him to say these words after what happened to him and he is just trying to protect himself. But I believe 2 years of constantly being a loving boyfriend is enough for someone to build up the courage to say these 3 simple words and he knows how much it means to me .... And another hard pill to swallow is knowing he how he treated her like a queen and how much he loved her, and how emotionally available he was with her and I don't see 1/10th of that when it comes to me... Keep in mind I'm absolutely in love with and also want the best for him.. with him acting that way I'm starting to believe I'm not the one for him. Could it be that he is still uncomfortable with his sexuality and it's a hard pill for him to swallow as homosexuality is the biggest taboo here!? He has told me that he would have never imagined he would feel this way about a guy...  What should I do?  I'm happy to provide more context if needed",1

Tldr; found out I was pregnant f27 after being sick a couple of mornings in a row, took a test, told my boyfriend M24 and now he's acting like it's my fault.   Hey guys, on Monday I decided to take a pregnancy test after I was sick 2 days in a row, the test was positive, and the worst part is I wasn't shocked.  About a month and a half ago my prescription of the pill I'm on ran out, and the pharmacy didn't have anymore (I live in a rural village) until the following Monday, so I avoided sex with my boyfriend, and explained I'm not wanting to have sex until I'm back on the pill, he decided to ignore this and said he will pull out.... He didn't.... I went and took plan b, and it clearly didn't work.  Now he's saying that it's not him that hasn't been taking the pill, and he's waiting to see if I can have an abortion or not. His reasons of being angry and no support are , he doesn't want to be forced to have a kid he doesn't even want.   In March my dad passed of pancreatic cancer, and it was traumatic, 3 years ago my dear mother passed of breast cancer, I feel like it's the wrong time to have a child as I'm still healing wounds and grieving.  My boyfriend isn't taking this into consideration, he just seems to be selfish, he doesn't even care about how I'm feeling right now, which is scared and uncertain. Today I asked him why he's off, and he said he will move to Australia if he has to be lumbered with a kid..... Even when I'm being sick or feeling so drained he doesn't show any sympathy, he just says   this is your own fault   I mean.... Surely if he really loved me, he would at least pretend to care.   I'm just feeling very sad just now :(",1

ThrowRA9090897,Fiancé (27F) threatening to call of wedding if I (M26) don't let her parents (M57/F50) move in with us after the wedding.,2161,14aekm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14aekm3/fiancé_27f_threatening_to_call_of_wedding_if_i/,826,2023-06-15 21:51:01,relationship_advice,"TLDR: After my grandfathers death six months ago, I inherited 90% of his wealth with a no contest will. Granting me not only enough money to never work again, but also a massive estate he claimed was his 'hunting cabin.' It's big enough to fit my Fiancé, my parents, and her parents comfortably. However I said I didn't want them moving in with us, and now it's turned into a total blowout. To those who will ask, no common law doesn't apply to us, and after a heated debate she agreed to sign a prenup (with witnesses around) if I agreed to buy her a 'nice ring, and a vacation once a year.' She clearly isn't with me for the money.     Obviously this comes off as a 'rich people' problem, but up until 5 months ago I was still living in a one bedroom apartment working at a rather large supermarket retail store making $12hr, and going to be paying off college debt until I was in my 60's. My Fiancé is still working her nursing job, and we've been fully living together for four years.      Some background into our relationship, we met six years ago. There were literally zero issues with us dating, when it came to some sort of conflict we sat down, explained both of our sides like adults, and generally fixed the problem. We've rarely gotten into arguments, and have the same end goals in life, children, grow old together, die be buried next to each other, and have fun whenever we can. I've always had an incredibly distant relationship with her parents, when she introduced me to them they both stated they 'didn't like me' to my face, and thought I 'wasn't good enough.' Her father even said 'not in my lifetime.' When I asked for his permission to marry his daughter, which I stated the only reason I was doing it was for an olive branch.      My parents on the other hand love my Fiancé, they scooped her up like she was one of us from the start. Has never said ANYTHING bad about her in public, nor have they in private. She at least in my parents eyes is the metaphorical second coming of Christ.     During my grandfathers decline in health, I was the first one there. He just got old, and with being old comes complications. I stopped working my 'higher paying' job to work retail to have more time to take care of him, because his other children were 'busy.' This was a very stressful time in our relationship, I had just recently left my job, was not around often, and I myself was super stressed.      Recently, I've began the slow move of everything over there. While we still have to 'live' in our apartment until the lease agreement is up, there's nothing against the rules of me moving stuff. I brought it up to my girlfriend how taking care of my grandfather, has really made me realize how important my family is, and that I wanted to know if It was okay for my parents to move into the new house with us. My dad could retire, and my mom can spend the rest of her life relaxing not stressing over bills/debt. (because, I can pay that off over time. I'm not insane enough to pay it all in one go.) She expressed how that was an amazing idea, and how she'd like her parents to move in as well. I laughed at the idea, and asked her if 'she was serious, and why would I want to live in a house with people I don't like, nor want to interact with?' She explained that this could be a good chance at us healing old wounds, and making amends. I explained that not only do I not want to heal old wounds, if it was up to me, they wouldn't be coming to the wedding.      Obviously this was the wrong thing to say, and now she's giving the the ultimatum of 'let them move in, or the wedding is off.' While I can understand her side, I seriously do not want to interact with them in any capacity. They've tried numerous times to get her back with exes, lie about me, even spread a rumor about me being unfaithful, until I pulled up real evidence of me being nowhere near where they said I was thanks to google location. My Fiancé knows all of this, and still wants to try and 'rebuild' a relationship with them. This past week, I've been avoiding her with excuses/white lies. I've been meeting with accountants, lawyers, wedding venue people, and jewelers. I've also been spending all nighters at my grandfathers grave drinking with him, and not getting back home until 4am. To me, it feels like my Grandfather is still the only person I can vent my deepest secrets, and frustrations to.      Which is why I've come to you Reddit, I feel trapped. On one hand I do not want to live with people I absolutely hate, and on the other hand I do not want to lose the woman of my dreams. I want a third parties opinion on the matter, with no connection to me whatsoever as I feel it's the best way to make a good judgement without people close to me influencing my choices.

ThrowRA06913,I 22M have been dating my gf (22F) for two years. Throughout the years ive learned i need to change the way i love and i dont know how to show i love her. I also dont see how this is different from a friendship as all the things we do is what i do with my close friends. (Aside from cuddling and 😘),3,148bnlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/148bnlb/i_22m_have_been_dating_my_gf_22f_for_two_years/,7,2023-06-13 09:57:40,relationship_advice,"I (22M) have been dating my gf (22) for two years now. We have an amazing relationship and are able to communicate well with our issues, but sometimes it feels like i am not being heard.   Some of these issues have arisen because its how i understood how to love and show care to someone. One of these issues was that the way i knew how to show i cared was by checking in with her and asking if she had made it home safely. I used to ask if she could text me when she gets home from work (we used to be at the same college but she graduated a year earlier, so now we are long distance. Otherwise i wouldnt ask her since she comes home to me). But she told me that doesnt want to do it anymore because she feels like it could become controlling. Which i understand but i just genuinely care for her, and it helps calm my overthinking brain to know she is home safe. This all started because in the four years that ive been to college ive been woken up at night because ive had to take my friends to the hospital (six times) or ive had to call the police because my friend has disappeared and the last i heard from them was a call stating they were going to ☠️ themselves. So i get anxious at night and everyone makes sure to check in with me as i will be the most likely one to make it to them in time if they need me to rush over. So it sucks not knowing if she made it home. But ive almost come to terms with it, and when i know she is out with friends i just choose to distract myself with videogames with friends so i dont think about it. (She does go out to bars with her friends, but i dont really care about her getting hit on. Because she tells me when a guy does try to hit on her and how she gts them to leave her alone) Because i know i will upset her if i do ask.   Another issue was that she was still talking to her ex for the first year and a half of our relationship. I didnt like it because she would show me texts from him and he still clearly loved her stating “i wish i could go back and not mess up” or “i wish you were so we could cuddle and watch a movie” stuff like that. And i had asked her if she could stop talking to him because it makes me uncomfortable since he still clearly loves her. She wouldnt because she claimed she was her only friend and has a history of mental illness that will probably come back if she stops being his friend. My gf eventually stopped talking to him, after her best friend pointed out that he still loved her. And honestly after about a year of trying to reason with her i gave up, because i was just done with the whole situation.   Another issue is that whenever she is struggling with something that i know how to do or could make it easier for her. She refuses my help and get upset with me if i try to help her. It was hard on me not being able to help her but eventually i learned to just leave her alone when she is stressed out and let her deal with it alone. So she never asked me for help with things in the past two years. But recently she keeps asking me to help her with things that it annoys me now because i learned not to help her and now its just magically okay if i do.   A big issue i have with myself is i dont know how to show i love her. Because in a relationship i learned that they are supposed to work as partners and be there for each other. But it feels like anytime there is an issue we have, we communicate and the conversation with me having to change and she doesnt. And i just dont know how to show i love her. Because i cant check in with her to make sure she is safe and doing okay, i most of the time cant help her with anything and if i am insecure or jealous in the slightest im in the wrong. So my big question is how is a relationship different then a friendship?   When we are in person together, we go on dates. And aside from that we barely text everyday and call about 1-2 hours each day because we both work fulltime jobs and she is taking prep clases for grad school. I get her or make her gifts when i can. But aside from cuddling and making out i dont see how this is different than a friendship as i do all of that with my close friends.",1

At 27, I was deep in a depression that was incredibly unfair to my then-husband. In his resentment, he was unfair to me too and we puttered along in a sexless marriage. We were best friends, but really only in that we spoke each other's language so fluently we both felt we could not connect with other people whatsoever. We divorced. He brought it up and stood his ground, but I was unbelievably thankful. We both got unstuck. He went ahead with his career and figuring out how to be himself. My path was weirder. I spent a year living on my savings and a few crafty lies. I hung around in the music scene and did more personal growth in a year than I'd done my entire life. I learned new things about myself weekly and radically changed my limiting beliefs about myself and life. It's true that I also did ridiculously irresponsible things. But it was worth it.   I got a job in an industry I had recently become interested in. I loved it. I met a guy at work, 22 years old, who lived with his parents and never really did any household chores. Tried to move out but couldn't hack it mentally. I didn't want to hang out at his parents house, like  Hi I'm the almost-30 burnout who is boinking your son!  and I didn't want him to see my horrendous party/depression pit house.   So we hung out in our cars, staying out till 4 am and taking our respective 40 minute commutes home, just to nap and get to work at 8. I was still living irresponsibly. No longer with drinking and shows, but with not sleeping and never being home. One of my heat sources broke. My water froze. I was hardly home to take good care of my dog. I did what I could to keep the house warm enough for her. I have no idea how I functioned at work. The 30 lbs I lost on a diet of gin and moshing came back in two months of eating fast food lunch&dinner together. He went home to his parents house where everything was kept clean and warm by responsible adults. I went home to a cold, absolutely filthy house. I swore I would take a weekend to start cleaning so we could fuck in a bed for once. I gave up and hung out at his parents house in his room, hiding as much as I could.   And one day, I couldn't do it anymore. It was 40 below and I was so tired. I was tired of driving 20 miles home on icy roads at night on mud tires with no 4 wheel drive while trying not to fall asleep. I was tired of buying just enough heating fuel to last 1 day of keeping my poor, neglected dog warm in my filthy house. I was tired of climbing a ladder outside at 40 below to lift a 5gal diesel jug over my head and put the fuel in the tank. I was tired of showering at work and wearing dirty clothes. I was tired of sleeping over in his mom's house and wondering what she thought of me. I was also just...tired. Not a soul had seen my house in the 4 years I owned it except my ex and my parents. And certainly no one had seen it since I let it go to shit. Soup pots I couldn't wash even if I had time, full of dead flies that only stopped buzzing because I put them in the coldest room. Etc.   The lifestyle that worked in the summer when I wasn't hurting anyone was suddenly unsustainable and I'd been too lovedrunk to care. I was finally REALLY hurting myself. My pup. My house itself. I got out of a year of the party scene with no addictions, diseases, or debts but a few months of obsessive puppy love and I was absolutely destroyed by my irresponsibility. We were blowing all our money on hobbies and eating out.  He wanted to help. What the hell could HE do? I thought. He'll either be disgusted by my home and leave, or I'll be so disugted by needing help that I'll leave him and my job and go where nobody knows what a mess I am. What does HE know about keeping a house warm and clean and spending money on surviving instead of fun things? How the hell is this kid going to help? He couldn't make it on his own either.   But I was tired. I was cold. So I just cried. I gave up. I told him I didn't care if he saw my house anymore. It was all over anyway, I ruined everything. I just didn't have the strength to drive home and warm my house myself that night.   We bought some heating fuel on the way to my house. He got it running. I roasted him some old potatoes I had and he was SO happy to finally be in my life. My cold, smelly, ridiculously bad life. Pretty good crispy potatoes though.   We spent a week making a dent in the mess, scraping grime off the ruined floor with putty knives. The other heater went out. We scrounged for enough firewood to get through each day without freezing. This man who had never lived on his own or been expected to do household duties was getting me out of bed in the morning so we could both work on making my house livable. I started taking care of myself again. I started making food for him and planning little weekend trips for us. Summer is here and we are fixing the heat and the water. We bought our  affordable  dream car together. We still have a lot of work to do.   But he didn't turn away from me. He's worked so hard for me.  And his hard work has made me work hard too, fighting my depression. I don't know WHY he's into an older burnout with limited career potential and lifelong mental illness. But I do know no one has loved me like this, and I've never loved anyone like this. I never cared about getting better. About baking bread for someone and making sure he doesn't forget his gloves. We're both BAD at taking care of ourselves. I have no idea when the last time he brushed his teeth was. My pile of laundry on the bedroom floor seems to change but never get smaller. But we are okay at taking care of each other.  Our first  date  was eating instant noodles sitting on buckets outside work on a Saturday. We spent last summer fishing and eating trout and spicy noodles. This summer we are fixing a house together. It's not quite been one year. We moved fast and got financially entangled fast. By all accounts we are irresponsible and dumb. I'm turning 30 this year. I'm too old to be this stupid, right? He's too young (23 now) to know what he's getting into, right???  But I love him, and I'm not really sure I've genuinely loved anyone. He loves me. We both have a lot of work to do every day to show it, but we're both actually working on making our lives good for the first time for either of us.  I always thought the responsible, grown-up love shown in the drudgery of daily living was tepid and boring. God, I was wrong. I'd rather scrub floors all day with him than go to an awesome show or ride trains or any of that exciting stuff. Can't believe it happened to me. Looking forward to the anniversary noodles.",1

I could barely even talk because I was out of breath from crying so much when I tried my best to formulate a coherent sentence and ask him why he would do this to me, he simply responded by saying  I can choose who has access to my body . What?? This has mentally f\*cked me up, and I still can't comprehend this situation. He texted me today that this  doesn't have to end our relationship  and some paragraph asking me  why  do I  care?  when  it's his body  and not mine. I tried to explain to him that I valued him being faithful to me as a fundamental part of our relationship and not sharing his body with anyone else, as I would be faithful to him. Also, we never agreed to be poly or anything.  He now says that he  understands  how much I  value his physical body  (I never said that) and will be  fully aware  of that going forward in our relationship.

We’ve been together for over 2 years—not married but talk about our future, and he’s 100% sure he wants to marry me. Moved in together last year. We have a great emotional connection and deep conversations. However, there seems to be no end in sight to his gaming addiction (a major turn-off for me) after many conversations about it, and all the stereotypical ADHD-related issues/stressors are present. I know the affects this would have on parenthood if we were to have a child with ADHD (a likely outcome), on top of all the other things we’re already dealing with. I’d feel even more stressed and alone than I do now.   We also have other lifestyle incompatibilities that I don’t think are sustainable.

We do have fun times and laugh together, support each other's goals, and I feel emotionally safe with him. We have the hard conversations and have both made accommodations in the home for each other. But sometimes it feels like that's not enough to outweigh the other stuff, and the on the good days, I question my other thoughts. I know, such a stereotype.  I’ve read tons of articles on both ADHD and gaming addiction, suggested different things, we touched on the subject (though he doesn’t know about the non-attraction part), we have frequent check-ins, we’re in couples therapy. I don’t expect relationships to be a walk in the park and we’ve worked through other things, but it’s starting to feel like maybe this isn’t the one for me. I think it’s a gut feeling but I’m also not sure (we’ve broken up before.) I love him very much, but I’m not *in love* with him, and none of this is helping.  I don’t want to make a choice I’ll regret, but I can’t seem to ignore this nagging feeling either. I don’t know if the tension I’ve felt recently and in our past is due to me trying to force something that isn’t for me, or if this is just the way all long-term relationships are. Curious if others have been in this situation both on the breaking up front or sticking through it…  TLDR: My partner and I have been together for over 2 years, he has (undiagnosed) ADHD and a gaming addiction which have both created so much stress and tension for me despite my efforts. I’m still not physically attracted to him, but I love him very much. Should I break up with him?",1

I have to stay guarded. Life is too painful as it is. A broken heart can derail things pretty easy. I know she's guarded as well because of past shithead boyfriends. Things are moving fast though. I went over to her house just to hold her until she fell asleep. It brings me intense joy to make her feel comfortable and loved. I am a giver and a lover. There is a lot that we have to overcome to graduate to an actual relationship. There are kids and dogs and mental illness and health issues. I am curious if we will make it. I had previously given up on love. So it's essential that I stay guarded.   But people, there are fireworks happening. Chemistry is something that can only be felt. It can't be described because it's your gut, heart, and mind all pulling you toward a counterpart. It's indescribable. When we wrap ourselves around each other and kiss. You can hear symphony music. I know it's cheesy but I don't care. It's straight out of a movie.   All these things to overcome are very scary. Some I'm not sure can be. I don't know if my health will hold up for a new relationship. She's got so much life ahead of her and I've been expecting mine to end very soon.   If love can't prosper than nothing will be able to.

I’m no complete fool anymore when it comes to relationships due to horrible experiences in the past… I’m aware of the honeymoon phase danger where you see every red flag in those rose colored glasses, so I’m extremely careful and vigilant to see any potential problems. I value my mental health and I don’t want to be stuck in another relationship where I’m being drained, abused, or lied to. Until around 2-2 1/2 weeks ago things have been perfect however, things have took an unexpected turn. She went from being extremely loving, caring, attentive, and extremely interested. To some sort of weird neglect that I can’t even comprehend. For some context she told me she had loved me first, I had no issue saying it back so soon after starting to date because I have loved this girl for so long I would/would’ve done anything for her. We had started to be intimate in the bedroom in ways  and everything was going amazing however, until news that she had caught something from an old ex after getting tested for a requirement of a planned parenthood bc procedure… She had randomly told me she probably has to break up w me I was so hurt I loved this girl with all my heart I didn’t care what happened in her past that wasn’t her fault the dude was an asshole and lied I can’t blame her I comforted her and told her whatever she needs but I was willing to stay by her side regardless of sex. She was cured a week later and everything was good until two days after the cure… She would stop showing interest in kissing me back, she was no longer attempting to be intimate, not saying I love you back, and it was killing me. I was so upset because I don’t know why I was being pushed away so I assumed I was doing too much I wanted to respect her and make her happy so I stopped trying to kiss her. She would just be Sahara desert dry and anytime I came over she would ask to smoke w me and then just fall right asleep the second we finished. I’ve never felt so alone while being labeled as not alone I couldn’t take it anymore so I told her how I felt like she wasn’t happy. She told me I’ve been treating her like a friend ever since she told me about getting it from her ex in the past. She told me I never kiss her anymore, I don’t cuddle her the same, etc. I responded with trying to give her my perspective “I’m sorry it’s felt like I’ve been treating you like that however” and mentioned the fact she had stopped kissing me back, she had started pulling away from me in bed to fall asleep away from me, and I’ve never stopped expressing my care for her. She then admitted to “pushing me away” but never gave me a reason and told me she thinks I only hold her hand in public when other people are watching, which is completely false even though her feelings are valid. She told me we have to communicate better for things to work I agreed and thought things wouldn’t be the same anymore, but not much has improved. She never tells me she loves me anymore still and is Dry as hell with a few “babes” or “babys” sprinkled in. After her making a comment recently of missing her friendship with her ex while we were smoking my anxiety has been wandering to the worst places. I trust her however, I’m so hurt from feeling unloved I’m so vulnerable to my anxiety. Is this something I should give time to let fix, or talk about more? It hurts to have the girl I’ve loved for so long claim to want me and do this…  TLDR: my(m18) girlfriend (f18) of around 4 Months randomly has stopped kissing me back, saying I love you, has overall become super dry, won’t be intimate,and has no interest in doing anything but sleep lately. Recent mention of missing her ex boyfriend as a friend is starting to make me worry and have my anxiety flare up. He is the most recent ex and had tried to contact her recently. Should I give this more time? Talk to her? Do I even have a reason to be worried?",1

I call this a problem especially as, during my past relationships, I usually defended my partners with everything I had even if they were hurting me, exploiting me, and manipulating me: I believe I did that not because I loved those people, but because (in a very selfish way) I needed to  satisfy  the need to feel loved, to know I had someone who made me feel loved. I realize just now that, whenever i was in a relationship, i did not love the specific person for being specifically her, but more generally because it was someone who made me feel valued and appreciated. Of course this wasn't the only component of those relationships, but i feel like for me it was the main drive.   I have no intention to ask how do i fix this need, that's something i have to take care on my won with myself. I would rather ask about your opinions on this kind of relationships as a whole: is my  drive  to loving someone at least a part of what consitutes a healthy relationship? Or is it only something that makes it less truthful and honest (as in  i am dating you not because i love you but just because you are satisfying my need to feel valued and appreciated )?  And also, how can I even think to start a relationship? I do not know if I woild be able to recognize this feeling, as I do not want to hurt someone by being untruthful, nor do I want to be hurt as I was in the past.",1

I knew very shortly after getting engaged and cohabiting that we weren’t going to be getting married. I tried my best to see it through but am finding myself so indescribably depressed and want to leave.   She is a workaholic.  Due to this she makes quite a bit more money than I do. She refuses for me to go on her health insurance (my job, which I’m unhappy at doesn’t offer insurance) but it would be affordable given her income. I had a better job and dirt cheap insurance before moving to cohabitate with her. We cannot ever get married (if we were happy) due to this because my insurance is calculated on both our incomes despite us not sharing ANY money.  I pay for all my own bills and contribute to the mortgage. Including groceries for myself, we almost never eat together so it just works out that way. She rarely cooks or eats at home. I’m home at all times when I’m not at work.  I cannot remember the last time we had any type of intimacy and I speculate that she is asexual (which is fair and if she is I wish she felt comfortable communicating that with me.) I do all the housework due to her being a workaholic. Laundry, dishes, picking up after her and the pets, taking out trash. She hired a biweekly cleaning professional to do the floors, bathroom, and kitchen because I had back surgery and physically cannot complete those tasks.  I am so fucking alone. I get home from work by 5 and she gets home between 9-11pm. I get up early for work. So sometimes we don’t even see each other.  I don’t have any close friends here (I moved about two hours from where I was living the first 3.5 years of our relationship) We have one day off a week together and she usually spends it making me accompany her to a family gathering or we run errands then kinda ignore each other with our own projects or scrolling till she orders us dinner.   I have a lot of resentment. I have a lot of self esteem issues because of the lack of intimacy.   I sold my house to move here and now I am stuck. My family will not let me stay with them while I get myself situated financially. We have low contact due to emotional/financial abuse history.   Here’s where I fked up.  Because I am so lonely I spend an obscene amount of time online. a man who lives 15 hours away started to chat with me. For about a year.  I’ve identified as a lesbian for the last 10 years and I don’t know wtf I’m doing.  I thought maybe I just valued the friendship but I’m so wildly attracted to everything about him.  Recently he said “you hate everything about your life. Just come move here. I’ll love you forever.”  I want to do it. I’m actively preparing to do it.  He said he will come visit me in person before the end of the summer and then he will get us an apartment in his city when his lease is up. I’m aiming for September.  I trust my intuition 100% when it comes to interpreting people. This man has no red flags (is that a red flag?) He is the most emotionally intelligent man I have ever known.  Cheating is wrong. I have been cheating emotionally. When he comes to visit idk if I could keep myself from physically cheating.   I don’t know how or when to talk to my fiancée about all of this?  We have have innumerable conversations about the issues I outline above. I have tried everything I can think of to communicate to her how miserable I am. She has countless times told me she would make more of an effort with me.   However I feel that she is so absolutely aloof that she is going to be blindsided by this news.   TLDR: My (35F) fiancée (F44) is a terrible partner and room mate and I have fallen in love with someone else and want to move 15 hours away. Wtf do I do now? How do I tell her?",1

However there are some significant incompatibilities bw us that is making me wonder if love is not enough in this situation.   For example, my bf currently works in construction, and he desperately does not want to work anymore. He is not a lazy person in general, he just does not like working for money. I work in a corporate environment and make more money than him. While I don’t love working, I have accepted working for the majority of my life as a likely reality. He repeatedly has said that he would like to be a stay at home dad, and other related comments painting a future of me being the sole provider. I have expressed to him over and over that I do not want this responsibility and that I want to function as a team in terms of everything- working, maintaining a living space, building together.   My bf and I do not live together- he lives w family bc he doesn’t want to spend money renting, he wants to buy a house. He wants to buy a house outside of CA due to lower cost of living, but I really do not want to leave. This is where I grew up, my family and friends are here, and in spite of the cost I love living here.  Recently we had a conversation about having kids, in which he said that he is ready and I told him I won’t be ready for another few years. I asked him questions like how would raising a kid together look? Especially if we moved out of state, and did not have family or friends to help with childcare, how would we manage the costs? He asserted that if he puts money down on a house for us then he thinks it would be fair for me to be the sole financial provider for him and a child at least in the short term. I don’t really believe that he means short term bc he has expressed so many times that he does not want to work. This did not sit right w me and really drove home the question for me of whether love is enough to sustain this relationship.   We unquestionably love each other and we support each other in so many ways. But when it comes to a lot of the practical side of building a life together I have doubts. Are these just items that are worth compromising on? Is love enough and am I just overcomplicating things?",1

But she actually didn't want to go further and it reminded her a trauma where she got raped by her stepbrother when she was younger. (he was confused and kinda insisted for 1 minute). After that their relationship degraded a lot and they almost didn't talk for a month, so my friend decided to leave her. They didn't talk to each other for two weeks and met again, apparently they are still in love, kissed but are still talking.   However, she tried to hook up with a random guy at a bar during these two weeks.

On Monday she messaged me to ask if we could go on a date together next week and to say that I was excited is an understatement. I said yes and was feeling great.   During the afternoon I was walking along a walking trail next to a lake and I noticed my wife sitting on a park bench with a guy sitting behind her with his legs around her giving her a massage. My heart sank. Shattered….   I walked over and didn’t say anything, she got up and walked me away saying we can talk about it later - that’s when my anger came out. I started demanding answers. It was a mix of silence, head shaking and deflection. I asked if she had called for her side of couples counselling and she said no. I responded “so you have time for him and not for me?” She tried to twist it me being angry wasn’t right. She then said that I have a problem with her having male friends, I said “only when you’re being inappropriate” I ended it with saying I’m sick of putting in effort and being made to look like a fool. And I walked away. The guy walked away during this time I was talking with her.   Later that night I got a message that reads.  “I rang the relationships line- I am not sure when you are dropping the boys back. I have rep footy this afternoon- till 6:30pm Will be dropping girls name back to mums and coming home.”  I responded with “yep” and with basic times I would be taking my boys back.  I am so angry, hurt and feeling so low. I feel like I’m no longer wanted, attractive or even worth anything. This really hurts.

I’m a 20-year old woman in college, and I started a relationship on December 1st, 2022 with the man of my dreams. I truly do believe he is the one.   We met on YikYak. I know. Random. We had no intent of finding someone when we were initially talking about a post I made. And then we quickly, within that first day of talking online, knew we were interested in each other. We met in person three times in the next few days, and then within that first week of knowing each other we started a relationship. In two weeks, it really just made sense to say “I love you” to each other because we both fell so deep for the other person.  I had never been in a relationship before him. I have had sexual encounters with about 9 different people before him, but I didn’t lose my virginity until recently with him. (Mostly related to trauma reasons, but nonetheless we have worked on that together and I feel fully comfortable with him sexually.) The day before meeting him, I was crying on Thanksgiving night to my friend over the phone because I didn’t believe anyone could like me - much less, love me.   Now we are 4 1/2 months in. We’ve had deep conversations and a true connection that we’ve both expressed we never want to let go, nor have we experienced this with anyone else.

It’s not a perfect place (in the sense that NO place is) but it’s fantastic and I fit in so well with the company culture, a lot of the people there, and there’s a lot of growth opportunities. I’m actually not in the job I plan to have in the longer term, I’m currently in grad school for my actual career path, but part of why I took a job with this company a few years ago is that they also offer jobs in my field and I hope to stay there once I graduate, except in a different position. I’ve talked with many people in the field at my job and most of them love their jobs there too. I genuinely love going into work there every day, the only thing I could wish was different would be maybe getting home a few minutes earlier or coming in slightly later lol.  My (serious) boyfriend (who says he plans to propose within the next year or so) found an INCREDIBLE job opportunity in his field in a city a bit further away from where we are now. I don’t want to go into detail but take my word it’d be an amazing, long-term opportunity for him and I want him to go for it. Right now my commute to work is like 45 minutes but I’ve been hoping for a shorter commute by the time we’d try for kids (maybe like 5ish years from now), so I always said I hoped to move a little closer to where my job is, but I don’t mind being like 20-30 mins away if we’re in an area that works better for him. However if we move to be closer to where this opportunity would be, the closest I’d feasibly be is like 1 hour from my current job, which I’d be ok with doing for a few months initially but not in the long term. Aside from this we both love the area we’re looking into, we think we’d have a good social life and fun things to do there (when we’d have the time for it… LOL) and they have fantastic schools too which is hard to find in our overall area (like if I drew a big 3 hour drive diameter circle, maybe 10% of the areas in that whole circle have good middle and high schools… it’s sad. For context, where we currently live is in the 90% and careers aside we don’t plan to stay here when we have kids)  What has been keeping me on the fence is that I’d likely have to ultimately find a new company to work for if we move there. I looked into local companies in the field I’d be going into, a few seem good but few seem willing to take “new grads” and also they have different vibes (a lot of them are smaller, there is one larger one that is supposedly good but it seems a little more “strict” and has some religious undertones from its history that I’m not thrilled about). So I fear I’ll either struggle to get a job altogether, or I’ll get one in a place I may not be as happy with, when I know I love where I am now. Or maybe I’ll stay with my current company for a while, but risk burning out from the commute and have limited time and energy for a social life (never mind that we’d be further from most of our current friends too, making it harder to see them and I’d hope to make a few new ones in the new area) so in that case maybe I’d still have my job I love but feel lonely and isolated outside of work.  I asked my boyfriend his rationale, he says his career ultimately should take presedence as he earns/will likely continue to earn significantly more money than me (true) and work longer hours than me (also true, even as of now he usually comes home later than me and that will likely continue to typically be the case). Otherwise he is fully supportive of me having a career, as long as it doesn’t come at the expense of his own. I’m so torn because this opportunity would basically change his life and really springboard his career, and I otherwise really like the new area. And I do want to marry him and ultimately, I’d pick being with him over working for this company, but I don’t want to have to make that decision… Unless I find a job I love just about as much, but that’s in no way guaranteed.  TL;DR: Boyfriend (who plans to propose soon) wants to move for an amazing career opportunity on his end, to be in an area we both really like and can see ourselves settling down in, but it may lead to me giving up my job that I love and possibly not finding as good of an opportunity on my end :( How do we reconcile this so we can feel confident it can work for both our careers before we take the plunge of moving - and of getting engaged??",1

He’s gone mostly during the day, and sometimes at night. We have a child and I am a stay at home Mom, and I like to go outside to get some fresh air and sunshine. But he has told me that I am not allowed to go outside unless he is home.   My husband is very narcissistic and controlling, manipulative and verbally abusive. But I wanted to ask, is this a normal behavior for men? My Husband “loves the Lord” but he sure doesn’t act like it.   He tells me to wait until he gets home to go outside. But what ends up happening is that? He is so tired from working that he’ll just go to sleep whenever he gets home. So I end up not being able to go outside for days on end And I feel very controlled and deprived of my natural rights. He made me feel bad about wanting to go outside yesterday because there are mosquitoes outside sometimes. I need some sunshine!!!  we live in a relatively safe neighborhood, and it’s a court.   Please let me know if this is common? Is this some thing that men typically tell their wives to protect them? Really looking for an honest insight from someone who is married or in a long-term relationship.   What I’m dealing with is someone who limits me very extensively. I only get to drive the car maybe 10 times a year maximum. He won’t let me go to the store, so I have to order all the groceries online. There’s always some reason for me to be restricted it seems.   UPDATE: Overwhelmed by the responses, truly, thank you everyone. As an update, I went outside last night while he was gone, and I knew he’d be home soon so I stayed out until that time. He was forced to act cordially because neighbors were outside. I could tell he was mad, but the situation forced politeness. I’ll be doing this regularly to expose his behavior until he changes (and just to get some fresh air). If he doesn’t change, I’ll be forced to make an unannounced exit for everyone’s well being. We’ll see how this new routine turns out!  For those claiming this is fake:  I’m sorry you feel that way, but this is my reality. Unfortunately I’ve been immensely isolated so I had to ask strangers on the internet for advice and use the accumulative courage they’ve given me to take back some ground that has been stolen from me. Quite literally so lol.",1

I am a secondary content teacher, which means I will be able to teach both middle and high school. My student-teaching placement was in a middle school in the Fall, and I have continued to substitute at the middle school.  Going into teaching, I always wanted to teach High School. But, I then got placed into middle school and loved it. I then would tell my boyfriend that I really liked middle school and that this is where I would like to teach. I enjoy it everyday. But, I also think it's a comfort. I really do like middle school because I did my student-teaching there and am comfortable with how the education system works. But, I never ruled out high school.  Now, fast forward to a couple months ago. I got a job interview (my first one) for a high school in an urban city. I want to live in this city, and after the interview, I was really confident that I would get the job.They offered it to me, and it’s one of the highest paying districts in my state. I was excited, and ideally decided that I would like to work there.  Now, ever since I got the job offer, my boyfriend has never been very supportive. He questioned why I was taking this job if I never wanted high school, why I didn’t interview other places (which I understand- it was my first interview and I did jump the gun). When the topic would come up, I would say I didn’t want to talk about it because he always tried to belittle me and question my motives. I never felt a sense of support for this. When I told him this, he said it’s because he knows me best and that he doesn’t agree with my decision because I “changed what grade I want to teach.” But, again, I haven’t even graduated yet!  We got into an argument last night. I sent him a picture of my school (first time seeing it in person) and he immediately started questioning my decision. He started sending screenshots of the school’s ranking (again, not the best as it's a public school in an urban district) but I tried to explain why it may be like that to him- poverty, lack of support, funding, etc. He didn’t want to listen, and then proceeded to call me a manipulator for the rest of the phone call because I changed my mind on what grade I wanted to teach. He then kept calling me toxic and said that I was manipulating him because I would say  I understand why you think that **but**...  He said that I changed my mind and that it’s disrespectful to him because I decided “at the last minute” and didn’t consult with him that I want to take this high school job instead of a middle school job. He also said that him talking to me at 4am about this shows that he does care because “a normal guy would just let it go and go to bed.”  It was late at night when we were talking, and then we kind of just left it and went to bed. I didn’t feel like talking about something like this that I feel he is irrational about. Then, he calls me 10 minutes later and says “I have a theory about what happened. You always wanted to teach high school. And then you met me and said that you wanted to do middle school. But it was always in the back of your mind that you were going to teach high school. Because you want to be the hot teacher with all the 17 and 18 year old guys walking around. That’s what it is right?”  After he said that I felt so disgusting and disrespected. I feel as if all along this is why he’s upset and hasn’t been supportive of my decision. It’s pathetic and gross, and I am just at a loss of words for how I should handle it. Once he said that on the phone I told him to stop talking and that I was going to bed. I haven’t talked to him since last night. I don't know how to even address this. Any advice on where to even go from here?  tl;dr : Boyfriend is not supportive and is accusing me of being manipulative because I took a job offer for a high school and not a middle school.",1

I went out the first time in a long time. My uncle invited me to an event and I had a strange feeling about it but I was excited to go out and have fun again. But for some reason I had a feeling that something could be happening. But I ignored it and tried to have a clear mind. So the evening started great I was already kinda drunk.( I don’t drink usually…) But then a good friend of my ex came out of nowhere… at first I shocked but I new that this could happen… We run into each other several times and then started talking… He told me he invited my ex as well but he didn’t reply as usual! So I asked him about him and how he’s doing… and we talked about everything going on since we met the last time… (the breakup was almost 10 month ago )  So he invited my ex again and he actually replied and came… I wanted to talk to him and motivate him because we both talked about the bad behaviors of him and that we were kinda scared about his health. I was super nervous but I went straight to him and we talked it was actually really nice. But he told me he was fine and he don’t use stuff anymore. I wasn’t sure of it but I tried to believe. Then we had a great night talked a lot and had so much fun. We drank a lot and then moved to a playground. I wasn’t sure but I guess we flirted but it wasn’t my intention!!!  He didn’t told me that he has a girlfriend… After the two friends went home we went to my place. After a few hours he startet to say that it’s bad and I didn’t understand what he was trying to say … So I kept asking him what’s wrong. Then I asked…  do you have a girl or what ?  Then he said yes. And said no one should know that please don’t tell that anyone… I was so shocked. And angry. The next morning he texted me the same shit again Now I’m so sorry for his new girlfriend  I feel bad and I don’t know what to do. I know that he won’t tell her  Should I reach out to her ?  What should I do ignore it ?  It’s so fucked up i need some advice.,1

I was fine with simply just waiting till I got to college or even finish college, I can't have irl relationships because of my culture (at least not until late years of college) I am someone who is constantly online and uses discord a lot. I've never really seeked out a relationship, until one time, a girl that I was talking to, told me she liked me. I also had feelings for her from an earlier time, these feelings were not that deep on my part but they were there, I ended up being in a relationship with her, it was my first ever one, I didn't know what to expect or anything but it was nice at first.  Fast forward a few days later she barely talks, whenever I ask her to talk to me more she would always tell me she doesn't like using discord, I was fine with that, but there were some days where all we would say is hi, hi, I love you, I love you too, not because j didn't want to say more, but because she's offline and I can't say more. She j was going to make a banner for us like something small for me to use as my phone wallpaper, she had sent me before a picture of her with a face mask and she was extremely covering up her face, despite me asking her multiple times to show me her face she kept telling me how she is insecure and doesn't want to show me her face. I also asked her multiple times to try and open discord more often just so we can talk she kept saying how she doesn't like discord. I got to a point where I didn't know what to do because it felt like there was no communication. My best friend told me to break up, so after a few days later I broke up with her and I felt really bad because I didn't want to break her heart.   I now feel like shit, like a child who was given a toy he really liked only for that toy to be taken a way from him and never return to him again, I understand seeking a relationship is bad because then one will almost never happen, but it just doesn't feel right I feel like I'm missing something, something that I might never get anytime soon.  So I'm asking you guys what do I do? I want to be in a relationship but I also don't want to be in a relationship where I'm ignored most of the time.

My friend and I met at work exactly a year ago, being office mates, and we connected quite well. But before I tell the story, I just want to say that as a bisexual person in a small town, the center of my social circle has always been straight guys, and I've never had issues with it. I've always had the ability to not develop romantic interest in friendships. So, when I look back at this situation, I don't know how I ended up here.      A year ago, when we became office mates, I did feel a crush on him. He's an attractive and sweet guy, and immediately, I remember perfectly, I tried not to get close to him, because I thought he was straight, at least until the crush faded away. But then, I felt that in our day-to-day interactions at work, there was some kind of reciprocation of attraction or at least; interest. It started with small gestures like getting me a more comfortable chair, waiting for me with coffee in the morning, the way his face lit up with a smile when I entered the office... Day by day, these details made me fall for him.      Perhaps they weren't the clearest signs of attraction, but... I let him in before the crush faded away.      During the following weeks and months at work, we started getting closer. I would say it was a pretty intimate friendship. After spending eight hours in a monotonous job, we would come home and call each other on the phone, talking until 2 am. We would spend weekends together, go out to dinner, make plans...      In one way or another, the relationship didn't feel like the ones I had with other friends. The closeness, the intimacy, the day-to-day interactions... It filled a loneliness that I didn't know existed, and yet, it intensified on the realization that he is straight.      But even so, I had already fallen for him.      Towards the end of the year, he met a girl, and I decided to meet new people as well. I met a girl, but it didn't work out. Shortly after, I met a guy, but that didn't work out either. I felt like I was already 'taken,' as if I had nothing more to offer in the romantic aspect, even though I knew it was all just an illusion.      Their relationship also ended up not working out. At some point, I don't remember the exact reason, driven definitely by my frustration, we had a discussion that forced us to sit down and talk honestly. We didn't define an  us,  we weren't that brave, but we did address the situation. And that's when he said something that both excited and broke my heart.       We're like a couple...  he said when we were talking about why it didn't work out with his ex, and he continued,  I didn't feel as appreciated as when I'm with you.       When we went out, he would sometimes comment on how comfortable he felt, maybe in our shared loneliness or heartbreak. He would say how he only wanted  this  (referring to the things we did together like going to the movies, eating, talking late into the night, making plans), but with a girl. My goodness! We even made plans to move in together.      At the beginning of this year, we both left our job. It was my escape route, a month of heartbreak, and eventually, I would forget about it. That was the plan, and I had executed it. I lasted only half a week until he came back to me, saying,  Let go of the nonsense. We're friends. We can stop talking for a couple of days to reduce the 'intensity' of the relationship, but we don't have to go away. After that, he didn't let go... He put more effort into staying close to me. And I, I let him do it.      By the end of January, I had landed a good job - remote, good pay, low responsibilities and stress. Sometimes there's nothing to do... (Truly a nearly perfect job xD). And when a position opened up in March, I gave it to him... Now we work together again.      And I feel like we're stuck in a loop. He's getting to know some girls, but he's already complaining about the same things, that it's not the same, that he doesn't feel 'appreciated.' And I... I feel trapped, hopeful, lonely, and in love.      So I ask for your advice. Just like that, it serves as a form of release.",1

This time its different, suddenly seemingly overnight she lost interest in me, she's emotionally distant, replies less, has zero patience, and even decline our monthly dinner which she always looked forward to which is normal for her when she is in a depressed state but this time it's different, something fell off and said she doesn't love me anymore, she doesn't have any reason as to why, she just doesn't but said she won't break up with me and need some space.   I know her, I know when she's having a rough time and she certainly is having one, she has a lot of things on her hand and is worrying if she would graduate on time.   So will I believe her that she got tired and she lost her feelings or is it just her depression? because even if I still want to be with her I don't want to force myself on someone who won't love me back lmao.",1

She uses Facebook a decent amount, which is left open on a tab on the computer. I went to use the computer the other day, and it was open to Facebook with the messenger app open and a conversation with some dude (“Vance”) readily visible. Turns out, her phone is synced with the computer, so Facebook messages pop up on the computer even if she received it on her phone. I don’t think she realized that. The message I could see struck me as a little too friendly for a guy I have never heard about.  So I scrolled the messages and they seemed to be starting to cross a line. Vance was asking her what time she likes to workout, whether she likes to look at attractive people when she’s there, and he tells her that he gets excited to workout when there are sexy people there, “like you”, he says to my wife. She responded to the question about looking at attractive people with, “yeah I guess” - which as a stand alone answer doesn’t bother me at all. But then there’s the context it was in. Vance then jumped right to “does working out make you feel hot?” Her response: “I guess it does.” He then asks if she likes to have sex after working out, and continues with “when do you like to have sex?” She responded with, “idk, it’s not on the top of my list right now with work and four kids.” After this, the conversation continued in a very friendly matter and was left off with him asking her when she was going to workout in the morning again, and her saying, “I’m not sure.”   Note: I am NOT a jealous person at all, and I have NEVER gone out of my way to look at messages she sends to other people. I don’t try to dictate who she talks with or who she is social media friends with. It’s one of the things she has told me attracts her to me the most, because I’m confident in myself when it comes to women (her).   Further context - when we met, she was 21 and I was 25. She confessed to me that she cheated on her previous bf with another guy for about six months. She also confessed to cheating on her first bf with his best friend when she was 16. She told me this early on in order to be open and honest with me, and she was terrified that I would leave her because of it. She was visibly extremely nervous to tell me, and stated that she was maturing and was aware of how bad it was. Definitely introspective about it. After she told me, she asked if that was something that would bother me in the long run, and if it’s something I would be able to accept as part of her history. I told her that she had not cheated on me, I had no reason to suspect anything, and as long as I never had a reason it would never be a problem.   In the 14 years since, I have never had one ounce of suspicion or reason to question anything. She’s never hidden messages or conversations from me, as far as I know.   I asked her about the conversation with Vance. At first, she said she had no idea what I was talking about (the way I phrased it sounded like I was asking her why Vance mentioned having sex WITH her, rather than the conversation with her ABOUT sex). So I showed her, and apparently it jogged her memory. I asked if she thought that was an appropriate conversation, if there are more like that, and if she has anything else to tell me. She responded with good answers, became tearful, and swore up and down that there is nothing to this other than Vance crossing the line and her not knowing what to say in the moment. She’s been extremely apologetic, stating it was dumb and she feels like an idiot for how it went down.   So my question is: do I have anything to worry about here?",1

She tells me everything: her problems, her triumphs, her pitfalls, and she supports and listens to me in the same way. We even went to another city together on vacation. She even helped me gain the strength I needed to start a body transformation journey with a conviction I have never felt before. She has been a wonderful and blessed addition to my life. Now when we first met, she had a boyfriend (who knew of me), which didn’t pan out and now she is single. As expected, a very attractive woman who can get almost any man she wants tends to find quick rebounds after a nasty breakup. Seeing these hookups and rebounds when we go out make me uncomfortable because of the feelings I have towards her, but I also feel it is my obligation to maintain this relationship as strictly platonic since it has brought nothing but positivity to both of our lives, plus I understand it is totally unfair to feel these feelings of jealousy when we have just a friendship. However, these developed deep feelings of love towards her still linger, which herein lies my predicament. We have never spoken about what would happen if these feelings arose, and I don’t know if it’s too late to talk about them since they are already here. So I guess my question is should I talk to her about these feelings I have?  TL;DR my best friend recently became single and after developing feelings for her, I’m wondering if I should talk to her about my feelings for her or not.",1

Our 2nd Anniversary is on 25th of this month.  For context we both suffer from depression and anxiety and live in unstable familes, but she has had to struggle with these more than i have, so i understand how this might affect her behavior.  So we belong to different communities, our country has a weird political climate, i belong to a minority and I have heard her say some very ignorant things. Her problem is that when she wants to be right, she forgets that i am her partner and will say things that are deeply hurtful. The last argument we had, she apologised right after, but I felt like something had flipped inside me, her apologies felt very self centered  you must hate me now   do you think im like those ignorant people now?  She never once actually apologised. When i told her that i was hurt, I could sense the agitation in her voice, when i wanted to confront her she had a breakdown and I had to comfort her for hours and i felt like my hurt was pushed away,and i just, that one moment made me realize that this is how its always been, all of our fights end like this. My thoughts, feelings, hurt dont hold any value for her. I dont even feel human, i feel like her punching bag.  When i started thinking about it, i was running out of reasons to stay, my only reason remained that i love her so much and cant imagine a life without her, but I cant imagine living like this either.   I spent the last week trying to get over our argument, trying to convince myself that it wont happen again, but then day before yesterday, she told me she didnt feel loved enough because for the past week i had not initiated any plans, I apologised and i reminded her that I had made plans, but she never agreed to go through with any of them, but then i conceded that I have indeed been feelinf weary of her for the past week, because i didnt feel like she valued me or my emotional needs based on the things she said and the way she acted. I was expecting her to atleast show some willingness to understand me, but her response broke my heart. She immediatly said  well why dont you just leave then . And my brain immediatly asked me the same question, why dont i just leave? I again felt the same feeling of being worthless to her.  So i told her yes maybe you are right and i should leave, because i dont feel like you treat me like a human etc. And her entire mood flipped, i didnt expect this, but she started begging me to stay, that i should give her another chance, how she understood she was being toxic but couldnt help herself  and didnt know what took over her sometimes . She asked me to wait until i recieved the gift she has sent me atleast. She begged so much, I agreed and said I need time. Now its been three days, and everyday I wake up feeling more detached from her than before. I dont feel like talking to her, or saying I love you back. I dont think she will take this well, i just want to leave because even though i love her, i am not happy. She was my first ever everythinf and now im scared of ever being in a relationship.  I want to know what i can say to her, and what i can do to finally be able to leave and do so in a way that is firm and doesnt hurt her too much.  Tldr: i want to leave my relationship of 2 years but my girlfriend is not taking it well and wont let me, i need advice on how to go about it.",1
Munchkin_queen3,My (34f) husband (38m) fell in love with someone else while we were doing an in-home separation but I changed my mind and don't know if I can win him back,167,1287968,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1287968/my_34f_husband_38m_fell_in_love_with_someone_else/,145,2023-04-01 01:37:48,relationships,"We have three kids together and the youngest is an infant. After agreeing to doing in home separation while I was still pregnant, I started having second thoughts about it after the baby was born. But I didn't realize he had been talking to somebody and developing feelings for them until recently. All of their connections have been text-based until recently and that's when I found out. I had been wondering why he had been asking what the next steps for the separation were when we had originally said that we wouldn't talk about it until the baby was a certain age and that hadn't happened yet.  Now that it came out, he said that he didn't tell me because he didn't want to hurt me. But he also says that he had no idea I was having second thoughts even though I said it quite a few times. And I think that if it were really true that he didn't know that I was having second thoughts then he wouldn't have thought telling me would have hurt me in the first place. That was part of the agreement when we decided to separate, that we would talk to each other about if we were talking to other people. So I feel really blindsided by this because I really wanted to work on fixing our relationship especially because of the children.  He hasn't made any plans to go and see her (she lives over an hour away) and so I'm not even sure exactly how committed he is to his feelings for her. Like it might just be a exciting thing and he thinks it's love because it's new. But she's also going through a divorce and has a kid and so it could just be that she's not ready to move as fast as he wants to. He talked about moving out recently but then changed his mind and said it was because the baby was so little still but that hadn't mattered to him a month prior when he brought it up to me. He only changed his mind after I found out about her. So I think his plan was he wasn't going to tell me about her until after he moved out But now that I already know he's killing time until he can just move in directly with her. Which would definitely help with the finance aspect of things which are tricky right now.  But I keep wondering if somehow I might end up winning his affection back by just being in close proximity to him. Since he's not planning on moving and we're not telling the kids yet we're still acting like a family like we have been for the past 10 years. I mean there are some differences like now he has boundaries that he has shared with me, mostly about conversations regarding intimacy etc. But even before I found out about her we hadn't done anything because of me being big pregnant and then just having a baby.   I just don't know if I have any chance of winning him back or not.  TL;DR! Husband and I agreed to separate in an in-home separation and I decided after having our third kid that I wanted to try to work on the relationship but it turns out he has already developed feelings for someone else. But he's still not planning on moving out and hasn't made an effort to go see her so I'm wondering if I might have a chance of winning him back or if I should just move on.",1

She always wanted to study abroad, live by herself, travel to new countries, etc etc since we first met, it was always her goal. After she found out she won the scholarship, we talked about the possibility of breaking up (neither of us wanted it, but i felt it was the smartest choice due to the difficulties of going on a long distance relationship) but she begged me to try making a long distance relationship with the plan of me going 3 months later after she went to Spain, so i can try and live with her and if i like the life, stay with her.      I liked the plan because i always wanted to travel too, so it was a win-win situation. The issue was that after almost three months of trying, she told me that she thought that it was an experience that maybe she want it to live by herself. She told me she made strong bonds with her new friends (something that she lacked in our country) and that she was afraid of losing those bonds if she have chosen to spend time with me. So in a way, she put in first place her new life over us.      I get it, even tho i was broken i kind of got that it was something that could happen if we went in a long distance relationship but still i hurt like hell to be seen as an obstacle after all we been through.      So that's it, we broke up after that incident. The problem that i'm having right now is that after all these months, we still talk regularly (every once in a month) either of us texts the other one to see how we are doing, how are things going, sometimes she tells me she loves, that she misses me, etc etc.      And i see these messages very confusing, i mean she wants to see me, wants to know if i'm still thinking about the idea of moving to Spain but even tho she chose to be single and to not keep on with our relationship. I feel like that she doesn't know what she wants, at least with me.      I had to stop following her in social media because her posts of her single brokes me apart, i sincerely don't know what to do...the fucked up part is that i still love her after all.      TLDR: My (23F) exGF is living her dream of studying abroad and fulfilling her goals but she still texts me (26M) that she loves me and still thinks about me.",1

We knew everything about each other and we were bestie vibes at work but also pretty flirty. It was his last day of work last week and we had a work drink event to celebrate. After the event, we ended up going home together in a movie - like ending. We are riding in the cab home together and he told me the kindest things a man has ever said. For example “you are so beautiful. Every day I come to work and want to make you laugh just so I can see your smile” and “just being around you has made me a better person” and more. The hook up it’s self was amazing and I quote the next morning he said “I just want to stay all day and hold you”. I had to work so he ended up leaving around noon the next day. That Friday we didn’t text that much and the Saturday he was kinda weird but he was with his friends so I wanted to let him have fun. Essentially, we go to a party on Saturday night and he completely ignores me and I am pretty sure I saw him leave with another girl. So does he just completely suck and I was led on for basically a year? It’s hard to take the things he said to me seriously if he’s just going to turn around and treat me horribly. He’s moving across the country in a month. I can’t decide if it’s better to just forget him (which is pretty painful idea for me) or give him a chance to make it up to me. I do value him as a friend, but why would a friend make someone feel this bad.",1

Like most disagreements, we both have our feelings on the matter and both think we are correct. So, I'm interested in outside perspectives away from our friends and families.   She lives in an apartment complex with a litany of problems. The property management company hasn't fixed the issues in over a year. Although she has options to complain and mechanisms to resolve things, she stresses herself out, feels defeated, and she is looking to break her lease. The stress of it all has her so emotionally exhausted that she has cancelled plans last minute several times because she needs her space to cope.   I suggested moving into my house. I purchased it 12 years ago. She loved the idea. During the pandemic we were locked down together and things were wonderful for months. This seemed to be an easy solution... or so I thought.   We began discussing the logistics and when living expenses came up everything went sideways. I don't know where to go from here.  She said that she wants to pay towards the utilities only. She will not pay a dime towards my mortgage. She makes less than me so I offered to let her pay 35 - 40% of the total living expenses proportional to our salaries. She said no because the  person I love shouldn't be charging me rent.  She felt she shouldn't be paying towards anyone else's investment because she will never get anything out of it. When I asked why paying towards someone else's investment was it's her rent in the past, she said  that's different.  How exactly, I haven't a clue.   I completely didn't understand her logic based on her response so I changed my approach. I mentioned she'd save around $1,000 each month not paying rent to her present landlord and covering some of the living expenses. She said I should  get out of her pockets  and if I can do at my bills without her, she shouldn't have to  help me.   While it's true I can cover my bills by myself, after a few unexpected home repairs and emergency veterinary visits, sometimes I'm damn near hand to mouth some months and haven't been able to rebuild my savings as quickly as before. It is not easy to try to save especially when I was thinking about getting her a ring, trying to pay for vacations and gifts for her, and updating things in my house which are long overdue. She said I should just borrow against my equity to take care of the expenses that way.   I really thought what I had proposed was fair and nothing earth shattering, but I've been wrong before.

I noticed he started liking girls photos on instagram and said something while he was out of town for 2 weeks. Convenient timing for him. I’ve never acted suspicious before. He usually questions everything I do (he stalks my follower count every day) and gets mad at me for little things (ex: following back a male coworker). I’ve never actually betrayed or cheated on him although he always talks about what I’ve done and I feel crazy.  When he got back I asked to see his phone (totally clean obviously). He literally said “I knew you were going to do this.” I didn’t look at much because that’s not my style and he knows it. He told me he deleted fb. Sketchy. (We are not friends on fb because I am barely on there and I don’t need him stalking me on there either). Eventually got him to reactivate it when he got scared I was going to leave him and I found he was liking/loving girls’ photos for a year. He even continued liking girls photos after I had called him out for instagram. Just found out today when he let me look again he was sending out friend requests to random girls every day too. I don’t even know what that means. Is he on a dating app or literally just finding these girls on fb? I feel like a total idiot for ignoring my intuition!!! Like he got the satisfaction of tricking me. Having his cake and eating it too. I’m so angry I could explode and I have this uncontrollable desire to find out more information. My friends are telling me I already know enough. Leave. That is the best revenge.   But I keep seeing him and asking more questions. He lies so comfortably. We have spent every night together after work and free moment this year which makes it hurt worse. On top of that, I hate the fact that he got one over on me because he told me his reason for constantly questioning me so much (he’s asked to go through my phone a couple times and I didn’t ask for his for some stupid reason) was because he hates the idea of someone getting one over on him. I am glad I found out about fb because it’s way more tangible evidence. And I only did because I stayed. So part of me wants to stay and find more.  What do I do with this anger? Why do I want to know more? What is the addiction to women and fb about? Is he probably talking and hooking up with them? Any advice of any kind is welcome. Thank you so much.

Sudden-Pianist-6991,My boyfriend (28M) cannot say “I love you” to me (24F) after almost two years,0,14dmodq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14dmodq/my_boyfriend_28m_cannot_say_i_love_you_to_me_24f/,6,2023-06-19 18:35:56,relationship_advice,"My boyfriend (28M) cannot say “I love you” to me (24F) after almost two years.  For background my boyfriend is amazing at expressing that he cares about me in his actions, he is one of the most caring and generous people I know. I got ill with a long term condition not long after we met, despite this being hard he has not abandoned me, he always makes an effort to find things we can still do together, makes me laugh, looks after me when I’m sick etc (which has been a lot). The sex is great. Physically he displays affection like hugs/kisses which he didn’t do much initially but has improved at.   One issue though is that he is not verbally expressive, he very very rarely compliments me, or says things like “I had a nice time with you” or “can’t wait to see you”. He had a difficult childhood, dad left when he was little, mum had mental health issues, was manipulative etc. He said his mum was the one person who said “I love you” growing up, but her actions always showed the opposite. The one person he said “I love you” to was his ex who he was with from 14-21 and she ended up cheating on him. I can understand why it is difficult for him to verbalise his feelings, but it is hard sometimes. I have an anxious attachment style, so sometimes it does lead me questioning wether I’m second best to his ex, wondering if I’ll ever hear “I love you”. I know actions speak louder than words, but it’d be nice to have the verbal affirmation sometimes.   My boyfriend is autistic too (high functioning) so I understand that he does not necessarily process or show emotions in the same way I do. For example he doesn’t say “I miss you” as he said he doesn’t feel sad as he knows he will see me again when I say goodbye.!This was hard for me initially but eventually I got used to it. It is difficult though knowing he was able to share his feelings verbally for his ex, but he cannot for me. When I said that to him, he says he was a different person when he was younger and said things without as much thought.  I raised for the first time that he does not say “I love you” in feb and it was quite emotional for him, he cried. We chatted and kind of left it. Recently I raised it again.  He said he struggles to say “I love you” as it is not an obvious emotion like “sad” or “happy”. It is common for autistic people to strongly go against dishonestly or lying, he says he feels like he doesn’t just want to say it for the sake of saying it. He says he can’t say something he doesn’t fully understand himself and he’s not sure if he’d ever be able to.  I feel stuck as part of me thinks “why do those words even matter?”. Then other times I get sad I don’t hear them. I did bring up therapy, but I don’t think he’d go. I don’t want to keep pushing the subject but I’m also not sure I can stay in a relationship forever where I never hear I love you, or have verbal affirmation of how he feels for me. But equally I don’t want to give up on him as he has been there for me despite how hard the two years have been and I do think I love him. I want to help him be able to open up again, but I’m not sure how.",1

I’ve known him for about 2.5 weeks and we’ve just been going on very casual dates so far. We met for coffee and icecream before and today was meant to be dinner.  He’s very polite, kind, quite cheesy, always asks my permission for anything, always asks if I’m okay with whatever we’re doing etc. It’s what attracted me to him because a lot of the men that I’m used to are just rude or mean and don’t care about any of your boundaries. However one thing I will note is that he’s a little clingy for knowing him for 2 weeks, but not in an obsessive way or anything, on our second date he asked to hold my hand and it seemed like I just told him he won the lottery and when I’ve seen him since, he always goes for just little touches and caresses me. Since my car is broken today, he offered to pick me up for our next date but then we kind of just got to talking and chilled inside my house. We had a great time just talking, and as he was leaving, we hugged and then he was like bye, i love you and then he was like oh shit I’m so sorry and then rushed out the door really quickly. The poor guy was so embarrassed, I tried to reassure him that it was okay but he got so red.   Any thoughts?",1

I 23f am somewhere on the demi/ ace spectrum I haven't quite found a label that fits, in general I do not normally experience romantic attraction but when I do I am far more attracted to the persons personality rather than them physically.  Now on to my issue, my boyfriend and I have been dating for 2 years and he is by far the best person I've ever dated. He is kind, very smart, and all around a great and fun person to be with. The issue at hand is I am not sexually attracted to him (physically) at all. I deeply love him, and am very, very attracted to him as person, but on a physical level I don't experience any sexual attraction for him.  He knows I'm asexual and this hasn't affected our relationship much, as we still have sex and I can enjoy it by knowing it's making him feel good. The issue is we talk about everything, no topic is off limits. We started talking about past relationships and he started talking about how he's never loved anyone as much as me, and that we connect on a personal,  emotional and physical level. I told him I've never loved anyone as much as him, but have been physically closer to others in the past. He seemed confused, but not upset so we talked about it a bit more and I explained that there have been a handful of people that I've been sexually attracted to.  This comfused him even more as he was under the impression I wasn't ever sexually attracted to anyone, and I stupidly made the mistake of saying just because I wasn't attracted to him doesn't mean I'm not attracted to anyone. He just kind of got quiet and changed the subject.   He hasn't really mentioned anything to me but I could just tell instantly he was deeply hurt, and the last few days he has been quiet and just not himself. When I ask what's wrong he says he has to process some things, but knows it's not my responsibility to deal with his feelings.  I tried to just give him some space but he has just been off, not rude or mean to me, just less passionate about everything.  How can I reassure him that I love him and want to be with him even if I'll never be physically attracted to him?",1
hammerwhorror,I (22F) and boyfriend (23M) broke up and are back together. I feel like he doesn’t love me as much as he used to.,2,144t4d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/144t4d2/i_22f_and_boyfriend_23m_broke_up_and_are_back/,8,2023-06-09 02:46:48,relationship_advice,"Hi, first time poster here.  I’d like to say first that I’m not asking for pity or anything. I made my bed and now I have to lie in it, just some general insight if anyone has any. My boyfriend and I dated from April of 2021-Thanksgiving 2021.  Our relationship ended because of several things, one of which was me not having a good grip on my emotions and my tendency to stonewall when upset. After the breakup I got therapy, spent some time by myself, went on medication, which really helped/helps. During that time, he found himself in a really awful relationship, one that I would say was worse than ours but he says “wasn’t as bad because he didn’t care so much.” I won’t say all the things his ex did but they involved hitting him, and she cyberstalked me.  Eventually though we got back together in June of 2022, so we had been broken up for several months. Our relationship is much better now and I think I can communicate more freely and effectively. My boyfriend does well with communicating too and doesn’t withhold affection from me and I don’t withhold affection from him either. The breakup we had and the relationship he had after that though, is a sore spot for him and he doesn’t seem to like talking about it. He doesn’t even like to talk about the start of our second relationship we’re in now. (Ex: I asked him how he felt when he drove up to see me for the first time after we had broken up, I was nervous because I was excited to see him as it had been months since talking. He’ll say he doesn’t remember or just brush me off.)  Our relationship is pretty good though and I’m happy. However, I feel as though he is not as passionate towards me or as freeing with compliments as he used to be our first time around. When I told him this (fairly casually in a conversation, I admit.) he didn’t really say anything about it. it felt like he was agreeing but didn’t really have a response.   I was just wondering if anyone else has dealt with something similar and if they ever got that extra spark back or if this is just a result of just getting more comfortable in a relationship. To clarify, I understand how much damage I caused in our relationship and towards him and understand if his trust with me is unstable because of that, it just seems like he does genuinely trust me and love me, but just doesn’t seem as in love with me as before. Is it a normal part of all relationships and just the end of a honeymoon phase or is it because of our poor relationship in the past? Are we just maturing and are less intense? Does anyone have any experience with anything like this?   TLDR: boyfriend and I had a rocky relationship. Broke up. Back together after months of breakup. He doesn’t seem to love me as much as he used to and is less open with compliments. Confused on if this is normal or not/if anyone has gone through something similar",1

I’m still in love with my high school crush and it’s been 9 years.",0,13w2aav,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/13w2aav/27m_23_f_im_still_in_love_with_my_high_school/,22,2023-05-30 21:12:29,relationship_advice,"I’m still in love with my high school crush and it’s been 9 years.  I’m still in love with my high school crush and it’s been 9 years, in 2014 to be precise. Here’s the story from the beginning:  We had a class together, but he was a senior and I was a freshman. The class was all about communication, so for the whole entire class, we’d do nothing but talk, like a break.   (All of my friends, including the ones I hung out with during lunch time, were seniors and I was caught up with what prom means and a couple of other things I couldn’t have known if I didn’t met them.)   Anyways, I fell hard for him, blushing, stuttering, rarely speaking to him in public because my heart would beat faster. I’d talk a lot about him and how much I like him with my friends… the twist is, it was crystal clear he liked me back, but I missed the social cues. When sitting next to each other, he’d snap his fingers under the table and close to me, to get my attention.   There were various times where he’d look at me and then look at my privates… wayyy too many times. When he made jokes, I’d catch him laughing and blushing out of embarrassment all while glancing at me to see if I wasn’t noticing. He had a group of friends and at one time, they all came and abruptly sat with me. I noticed he’d wink a lot while looking at me. They were really suspicious, one of them acting as an intermediary (the only one in the group I’d feel comfortable speaking with) to spark up a conversation so she could get the ball rolling and then I could eventually speak with him (my crush).   Within this conversation, he said to the intermediary friend “I feel weird. When I'm in this room, I feel like... I don't know.... Different than being outside with other people... Do you understand me, (intermediary friend’s name)?  Then he raised an eyebrow as if pointing at me.   ^ that’s just a snippet of the whole scenario that I wrote down in my notes app back in 2014, so this isn’t something I just came up with right now. I also wrote down what I’d first send him along with different interpretations of that first message, one being something like: “No matter what happens… I will always like you” … I would’ve thought “silly me” but now that’s proving to be true. (That experience happened AFTER the below 👇)  (This happened BEFORE the above) Learning his name, I found him on Facebook and sent him a friend request. He accepted. I went on to message him expressing my feelings for him and he appreciated it. My dummy self tried to be the interviewer, asking him questions about what his favourite movie, song, color, is… we spoke for a while… until he graduated. Months went by, maybe a year went by, and I decided, at around 16, to delete my whole entire Facebook account out of embarrassment for the stuff I had posted on my feed… a year or 2 went by and I played truth or dare with my cousin at a sleepover. I expressed that I still had feelings for him and she dared me to send him a friend request again on my new Facebook account. I did, but he didn’t accept.   Fast forward, 6-7 years later, and my feelings for him remain, very well knowing his whole personality might’ve changed, but despite that, there’s something about him that I love so much. I’m aware of everything that could go on, from the possibility of him being a relationship already, to the possibility of him not accepting my friend request again to maybe perhaps having the luck of reconnecting. I did notice he removed any form of information that would find it easier to find him on facebook (like the “goes to…”, “attended…”, “in a relationship” “works at…” etc.)… so it’d be kinda sus, confusing as to how I was able to find him. His at-that-time intermediary has an Instagram account.   I don’t know what to do since there’s no one I’ve met who’s ever made me feel that extreme attraction. I don’t know if he’s single or taken. (My friend suggested to create a fake account with a fake name and pose as a male friend who hasn’t spoken to him in a long time and just so happen to stumble across his profile. That’s clever until he clicks on it and finds out it’s a brand new account.) I grew up and was a senior, in his shoes, and even then, no one made me feel the same. I mean… went all the way to me having a dream of him on a romantic cruise date in 2014…. and… doing it with him. My subconscious wanted that… what were the chances he wanted that too.   (There were MANY MANY social cues that I missed that hinted he liked me back and I never found out because I didn’t pay attention to them. There were various opportunities where I could’ve spoken to him more or even privately, such as being the last one to enter a room and him holding the door for me. I could’ve used that opportunity to pull him aside. My thinking, I believe at that time, was that the more I ignored him, the harder he’d fall for me, but I let that thought play out till I lost him…)  Ages:  23, and around 27 Female and male  TLDR: I had a high school crush in 2014 who I added on Facebook. We had small conversations in person, but I was too shy, and he was nervous (not a good combo). There were obvious social cues that I missed like snapping his fingers under the table to get my attention, winking at me numerous times and looking at my private part. There were also times I could’ve pulled him aside, like when I was the last person to enter a room and he was the one holding the door. I expressed my feelings to him through message and he appreciated it. I thought the more I ignore him, the more he’ll fall in love with me until I lost him (he graduated). 2 year later, I deleted my Facebook out of embarrassment. I created another account and added him again as a dare from my cousin. He didn’t accept. I noticed he removed statuses like work, education, relationship etc., making it harder for anyone to find him, but I managed to find him. Since then, 7 years from the dare, I still have feelings for him, I mean it went all the way to having a romantic dream in 2014 and doing it. I don’t know what to do, if I should friend request him again or message his at-that-time intermediary or who else knows what to do?",1

We went through a lot of s**t together, and generally allways had a good and healthy relationship, with some occasional ups and downs here and there. We did a lot of growing up together, same as many big changes (we met when I was still in high school, so my and his university and all troubles, first job, moved in together last year etc). We are each other's first sexual parters as well. Until last few months, I was 100% sure I am going to spent my life with him. We had plans, talked about future trips, buying appartment and possible engagement. I still have his cute messages from january of this year how he wants to spend his life with me.  Three months ago we had a first talk. He told me he is not so sure about having children one day. We talked. He said he is now feeling better about that plus children are not something I want in the next ten years.  Two months ago he said me that he is not sure that I am the one, and that he thinks that I love him more than he loves me. We talked for hours, I even told him that it is okay to break up if he feels that way. Concludion was that he just wants to work on some aspects of our relationship (sex life, more quality time together etc.)  Yesterday we had another  big talk . I told him that I feel that all of the changes we applied made me happy (more sex, schedualed date nights). He bursted and told me that he does not love me enough to spend a life with me, but that I am his best friend and he loves me very very much. He also said that he feels he did not spend enough time with other girls because I am his first serious relationship. I asked him is there another girl he likes - he said no. I asked him is there anything I can do to change. He said no. I asked him what he want to do with our relationship now - he said he does not know. He loves me, but I am not the one.   The thing is - i am confused as hell! Just few months before, he was telling me how happy he was to have me. His friends love me, his familiy also, we were planing big trip to Asia next winter and buying our own appartment soon. When I ask for explanation, I get no answer.  I feel... Crushed. And also betrayed. I trusted him so much and also believed all he said  My question is what to do - to break up? Im affraid. I love him to the core and this is a very sudden change. To have a break? To wait for his reaction? It painful to be in this limbo  TL;DR: long term boyfriend decided I am not the one for him even tough rest of the relationship seems normal. What to do?

Since our 4th year together I've not slept very well. When we dated he was trim and athletic. Him gaining weight wasn't a problem for me. Until he began snoring. It's like a chainsaw in my ear every night.  It's been mental torture especially when I was postpartum because of his snoring.   I would go to another room and he would wake up and lay in the bed I moved to and begin snoring again. This would lead to arguments I didn't have energy for. He says he cant sleep unless im in the room, and then i say something along the lines of  you went your whole life sleeping just fine before we met.  The only time I can sleep peacefully is once whenever he went out of town for a business trip. That entire week I cleaned the whole house, garage, porch, made meals, kept a routine with 3 kids under the ages of 5. Two of them being toddlers. But I felt great. That's whenever I realized how much his snoring affects me.   I told him to lose weight or see a doctor. He's doing neither. But the snoring is so awful and I don't sleep. I'm now irritable, I look exhausted 24/7 all because I can't sleep. Its to the point that i hate my life and regret a lot.

It's gotten so bad for me trying to drink caffeine to keep up that I got a kidney infection.

I loved her, but I knew deep down that she wasn't a person with whom I could have started a family, or built a future (because of some fundamental issues we had, that led to our breakup).  I have been in 2 other 6-month relationships after that, but they didn't mean as much to me, and in the end made me feel more alone.  I feel really tired at the idea of getting to know people from scratch again, and I very often feel very distant and alone when talking to people I just met.  My first love maybe wasn't  the one , but the love I felt for her was far deeper than every other emotion I experienced in the last 3 years.  I feel like nobody will ever  get me  on such a deep level. I'm not scared of not being loved, I am scared of not being capable of LOVING someone, of feeling like that someone is the center of my universe. That's the only feeling that makes life real, I believe, I caught a glimpse of that and now I fear I'll never experience it anymore.  Do you think feelings get old?  Can you ever love like it's the first time again?",1

So me and my gf met on a dating app, it's close to 6 months now and we made it official 2 months ago, we've kind of being in a ldr for 2 months now(i came to my hometown for vacation), now onto the main part.  This is both of ours first relationship, so maybe I'm not doing things right. My day starts with texting her good morning, i liked her from our first date(1 month in), she's an amazing person, great personality and everything. I felt myself falling harder and harder for her, i write her  letters and poems(I've been into writing since childhood), bring her chocolates, flowers, food(I'm a cook by profession too) everytime we used to meet, ive never been much expressive of my feelings, but she told me when we were discussing love languages that she loved getting specific compliments and needs reassurance, and also asked me to communicate with her more, so i started doing it, but whenever i do she shuts me down. It makes me feel embarassed, since we made it official I've told her i love you a few times, but she told me not to say it, it cringes her out, and i stopped. She doesn't even acknowledge some messages/letters i send, which i deem important, as i started expressing myself more as she asked me to, but starts calling me cringe now. She hasn't even said once she likes me, let alone something like love, but she makes me cute DIY stuff like small paintings, origamis, sketches, polaroids etc everytime we meet and she says she likes my company, so I'm a little confused too. Around 2 weeks ago she said it felt like i was love bombing her, we had a long conversation, she asked me to stop complimenting her, saying i loved her, writing  cringe  messages etc, as she was feeling overwhelmed. I never felt my messages were cringe, i was just expressing how i felt,  it really took a toll on me cause i didn't mean it to come out like that, so i eventually stopped, she said she just wanted me to be a friend for now, and not get lovey dovey, for now atleast.   We used to call each other every night since i came here, but for a week now, she barely replies, let alone call, she says she doesn't feel like talking and that she is sleeping early(she says this but sends me reels at 2-2:30 am).   I'm a bit of an overthinker I'll accept, and her sudden change has made me feel like I've made her lose interest by accidentally love bombing her.  What i want to know is  1) Was i accidentally love bombing? Please let me know cause if i was i will do anything to improve myself and become better. 2) How do i make her feel that it wasn't my intention, and it came out wrongly.  3) If she has lost interest seriously(I'll wait for a week/2 to see if she continues the same behaviour) how do i proceed from there?  All these might sound dumb and childish, but neither of us has any experience and all this overthinking is taking a toll on my mental health and I needed some outside opinion.",1

For the first time in my life I fell in love. From the moment we hung out together alone I knew she was going to be my wife. I felt it in my bones. She was cheated on after a six year relationship and I met her three months after and we didn’t hang out alone until six months from her breakup and I knew she would be my wife.   We both felt this unreal connection and she was still healing from her past but I was helping her through it. We were inseparable, my best friend. One day hanging out in her room she told me she still needed space and time to think about everything and needed to be alone. I wasn’t hurt because I understood her. I understood everything about her and I agreed. I agreed to give her space because I loved her. We naturally drifted back together and it was on all over again.   After a couple of months of hanging out with friends and hooking up she told me she appreciated me as a friend. I couldn’t take it so I told her I couldn’t be just friends so I decided to stop talking to her. Within three days she called me and said she needed to see me. We went out on a date and it was amazing, boom, back to square one we were back to being madly in love.   We traveled, went to weddings, holidays with our families, it was all a dream. Valentine’s Day was the best date of our lives, I mean it was AMAZING! We spoke about kids, our plan in the future, saving money for our future, EVERYTHING!   She was in the midst of moving five minutes from my house, starting a new job, new semester in school and we were excited of all these changes.   I didn’t see her for one day, went cold on me the next, and sent me a text saying she’s thought about it for a week or so (Valentines Day) and she hates herself for it but noticed that she’s not in love with me but loves my soul.   It’s been a month and three weeks and I miss her so much. I read our messages look at our pictures and I can’t believe she’s gone just like that. If you’re reading this and you are in love please hug them extra tight, appreciate their sent, their smile, their touch because it’s the best feeling in the world. I wish I could talk to her but she blocked me and I couldn’t stand seeing her IG so I blocked her. I miss her with every single cell in my body.  I hope she comes back.",1

I'm generally not as affectionate/attentive as her so it feels like I'm always losing my mom's affection or her favor. When I was about 14, my mom would tell us how she feels that we don't love her, and (I don't know if she was joking) suggested that we make it a competition between each other. She's mentioned years later that she regretted ever saying that, but the damage has already been done, and I am 22 now and exhausted from this stupid game.   I truly try my best, I genuinely don't know how my sister does it sometimes, but I cannot get to her level. I cannot understand why I still feel like I have to compete, and I see the disappointment in my mom's eyes when my sister does something more caring, or loving, or anything like that than me. I can see that she's sad that I wasn't the one to do something like that. It breaks my heart but I am so tired of it. I really am. They definitely fight more because generally they're around each other more (just because of the nature of our work and stuff), but I don't think I can ever reach the level of closeness that they have with each other. I always feel like I'm one step behind. And I wish I could say whatever and say that I can find someone else, but I do not have anyone but them in my life.   It's so emotionally exhausting, especially since I'm not doing it on purpose. I just don't notice things sometimes, or I'm a little more selfish, and it can never be enough.  &#x200B;  TL;DR: Loving my mom is a competition and I'm always losing because my sister is always one step ahead of me.

KabeerS52,Can fading love be rekindled again? My [18M] girlfriend says she's not sure if she loves me anymore [18F].,1,14acrfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14acrfd/can_fading_love_be_rekindled_again_my_18m/,5,2023-06-15 20:40:26,relationships,"   (skip if you want to) So, not sure if it's relevant to this, but we had a fight about me doubting her parents for having three children while the wife clearly not being fit and causing various abortions and premature deliveries. I did learn my lesson that despite being logically right, you have to take the other person's emotions into consideration. You can't always be fully honest. And her not being able to bear what I'm saying or being offended by it doesn't mean she doesn't respect my opinions. Also, I shouldn't judge her relationship with her parents solely based on the facts she tells me. There are probably good things about them which I don't know of.  Now, the problem started after this fight was resolved. After a while, I simply asked her if she still loves me after this (I wanted to know if she loves me less because of this). I was expecting her to say yes or for it to be lesser after this fight. But the answer was way different.  She said she's not sure. I asked her the reason, and to my relief, it wasn't about this fight, but it turned out to be worse.  For context, we are in a long-distance relationship now. We met in school, spent years over there until a couple of years ago when our relationship started when we passed out of school (10th grade). Despite that, we used to text every night, and we were able to go on dates every week or two because I had my diploma college in the same city, and she was doing 12th in our same school building. (Keep in mind her parents are extremely strict and will never approve of our relationship due to racism [casteism] commonly faced by people like me in India). After a few months, she started coming over to my house once a month, and most importantly, we could video-call each night. She used to make an excuse that she was studying, so her parents would give her full privacy.  But now that she has passed her 12th and can't use the excuse of studying, things have changed. We can barely call maybe once a week, and we're unsure when we'll have to end it. She calls when she's home alone now. She can barely text me because she also gets interrupted in that. She just went on vacation and now is usually out with her family for finding colleges.  As you might have guessed, the more laid-back, fun, and deep communication we used to have is now reduced to only the essential, checking-in kind of talking for the most part, and that too only on text.  Now, this is my interpretation of why she says she doesn't feel the same about us now. Because when asked, she herself said that she misses when we used to  laugh, have fun, make each other smile.  These are her own words. There might be a different reason, but I can't find it. It might also be because I had acted really immature and needy in the past month when she was on vacation. I acted that way because I wasn't used to this distance. I used to mistake her helplessness of not being able to talk for her not caring enough to talk. This difference in need might also be because she was having fun but physically exhausted by the night, as opposed to me who was buried in my studies and work and meetings for my startup and as a result was mentally exhausted and in need of someone while being sleepless.  I also feel like this might be part of her mood swings because she recently started having regular periods. She hadn't fully hit puberty till now, might be because she was born prematurely and was always sick and weak till now. And I also, in my early puberty, have faced (for days) unexplained mood swings and unexplained disintrest for things or people. And atleast in my experiance, these mood swings were temperory.  So that's a relief if it's the reason.   Now, I asked her if she wishes to leave, she said, she's not sure. After giving her some time. She said she doesn't wanna leave at all. She did admit that she feels like the distance is a reason for this. I said we could dial back some commitment and be more casual, she said yes. After that, I said I love her (I always say it before leaving) and I told her it's okay if she doesn't feel it and if she doesn't wanna say it, I told her she doesn't have to say it just for the sake of it. So she stopped saying it, until 2 days later when I wrote a poem for her and shared it to her, after which she started to say she loves me.   But she's still unsure about everything. We've talked about it a couple of times since then, and every question I asked gets answered with an  I'm not sure . I shared an old video of us to her in the morning.   (It's taken at my house, I had bought her a necklace with my own money and I was opening the packaging behind her while she was holding the camera and filming me, a couple of comical things happen in the video and it ends with me putting thay necklace on her and kissing her).  She watched it and said, the video hurts her, she said she misses how we used to be.   Now, I don't blame her for not feeling anything since we haven't seen each other since a month and have barely called 2-3 times in that month. How can anyone still have their full feelings for someone who's essentially just a person on text? I mean, to love someone, you have to be able to remember their touch, voice, the little quirks  their body language, etc. Has she just forgotten that? I mean, even on texts our convo's aren't super intresting so. Maybe it's just distance or is it something more?   I really need to understand this situation, as you know I'm just 18. I'm not at all sure if this is totally normal or a frighteing and relationship ending situation. Please help me understand that.   As our routine, we will meet and spend 4-5 hours together at my house someday in the next 10 days. As for the damage control, I'm trying to find couple-things to do at my house to rekindle that spark, maybe stuff like cooking together, I'd like some suggestions on that too. Keep in mind we'll probably have the house to ourselves on that day. But we can't do outdoor stuff.   I'm also planning to buy her some flowers or choclates and stuff, We used to really like eating a bunch of choclates together in a messy way like lil kids. I figured doing that again would reignite some feelings in her.   I don't know why she's not sure of her feelings for me, I'd like to understand that. And I wanna know how I can bring those feelings back, maybe I won't even have to do anything and she'll feel things again as soon as we hug for the first time after meeting, who knows? Cuz I strongly believe her loss of feelings is simply because of distance. I mean, at this point, I'll be surprised if she even remembers my voice.  TL;DR: In my long-distance relationship, our communication has deteriorated after my girlfriend finished 12th. My GF says she's unsure if she still loves me. We can barely call or text each other, and she mentioned missing our previous fun and deep connection. I acted immature and needy during her vacation after 12th, possibly contributing to her uncertainty. Distance seems to be a factor, and she's unsure about her feelings. We plan to spend time together soon to rekindle our connection and seek guidance to navigate this anxious phase.  Just please, all the grownups, be my elder brothers and sisters, and guide me through this really anxious phase, I've lost my sleep over this.",1

I was hanging out at my best friend's house one afternoon and he called a girl he liked.  She had no interest in talking to him, so she handed the phone to her sister. My best friend didn't want to talk to the sister, so he handed the phone to me.  I said hello and heard the sweetest voice on the other end.  A two hour conversation followed with us making plans to meet at Her locker the next morning.  We met as planned and I was greeted by a beautiful girl with an amazing smile. We chatted as we walked down the hall and felt an immediate connection.  Hands were held and a budding relationship began.  Over the next almost two years we learned what love was or at least our interpretation of it.  We spent every moment together that was allowed by our parents. As time went on we began a sexual relationship. This expanded our love and exploration. If either one of us wanted to try something romantically or sexually, we tried it no questions asked. The two of us allowed a growth through love and understanding with no judgement or anger. Not a single argument during the entire relationship. We had become each other's first love and inadvertently set the standard for others to follow.  Ego, however got in the way. My ego. At 17 I began to wonder if being with one girl forever was what I wanted. So, I made the poor decision of splitting up.  Within days I knew I'd made a mistake, the longing I had for Her was insurmountable. However I was out of town for an extended time and since this was before cell phones I had no real way to talk to Her. When I finally returned to town, I headed straight to Her house only to discover that in an attempt to get over the heartbreak I'd caused, She'd forced herself to move on and felt it painful and wrong to see me again. I respected Her wishes and that was the last time we spoke for years.   18 years to be exact.   During that period I never felt the love from another woman that I'd experienced with Her.  In my heart, She had been my one true love. The dedication to a relationship She showed, the love and support She gave,  and the connection we had. Maybe I stunted myself for always thinking of Her,  but I only said I love you to two other women during those 18 years and the love I gave them never matched the love I'd given Her.   Eighteen years later we stumbled across one another on social media and began chatting. We were both married and thought we could handle talking to one another without issues. This was not the case. We eventually decided to meet up and things unfolded between us again.  I felt myself falling for Her again.  Fate however stepped in as we got caught for our indiscretion and both faced the marital consequences. She wanted to fix Her marriage and I chose to do the same.  She felt if we kept in contact we would find ourselves in the same situation, so it was better to walk away.  Again, I respected Her wishes and that was the last time we spoke again for years.   15 years to be exact.   I'd heard She'd been divorced for years, but still being married I knew  it would be wrong to reach out to Her again. Especially if all it came down to was another quick tryst. My heart couldn't handle that. If I were to be with Her again, it had to be more permanent.  Years passed and I'd gotten divorced.  I began to wonder about Her. Finally, I got the courage to send Her a message on social media.  Only to overthink and immediately delete the message. In my mind, I pictured Her happy in a relationship and I did not want to in anyway impede on that happiness by inviting what had occurred fifteen years earlier to happen again.  Later that day a message appeared on my social media from Her. Apparently when you deleted a message it shows the other person a message was sent and deleted. Goes to show my social media ineptness.  My heart beat in my chest as I stared at my phone. Two simple words on the screen. Hey you!    After a few seconds of mental debate, I replied and we chatted for a few minutes, where She revealed She was single.  I asked for Her number which She sent me.  Nervous, excited, my finger shaking, I dialed and within one ring She excitedly answered. The moment I heard Her voice, all those old feelings rushed into me.  This was all we had for weeks. Intermittent phone calls, chats about our lives, fun stories we shared, getting reacquainted.  I looked forward to Her calls and texts everyday. We developed a saying during this period.  I don't know what this thing is between us but.....  and each time She said it, my heart imagined what this  thing  might become.  Finally, we set a date to meet for dinner. Here I was, about to go on a date with the woman I'd always considered my one true love. I was beyond nervous, especially because a part of me wanted to express my love for Her, but my brain knew that was the worst thing I could do.   I arrived at the restraunt and stood outside near the door, searching the parking lot for Her. I turned around and there She was walking toward me, looking radiant.and more beautiful than I remembered. She walked right up to me and kissed me. My heart almost exploded in my chest as I felt Her lips on mine, feeling as if they belonged there. We broke apart from the kiss and entered the restaurant   As we ate and talked I had difficulty looking at Her, fearful my mouth would betray me and I'd profess my eternal love scaring Her off in an instant.  Everytime I looked at Her my heart skipped a beat, Her beauty was captivating, Her smile intoxicating,  Her eyes mesmerizing. I made it through the meal without accidentally saying something I'd regret.  After dinner we spent some time together then went our separate ways.   This was what we had for a few weeks. Meeting up for dinner, spending some time together, and phone calls. The time we shared together was amazing, but a part of me wanted more.  After some talking and alot of driving back and forth for both of us from my town to Hers and vice versa, we eventually decided to have Her stay at my place on Her days off.    The first night we slept in the same bed together I didn't get much sleep, lying there in disbelief, my mind in awe that after all these years She was asleep in my arms. All night I'd awaken and look at Her face resting peacefully on my chest, the moonlight coming in through the window illuminating Her skin perfectly. I almost woke Her up multiple times to tell Her I loved her.   Keeping those words trapped behind my lips was the hardest thing I'd done emotionally in a long time. I knew what I felt was real. Not only was this the person I knew to be my one true love, but the woman She'd become was amazing. Strong, independent, hard working, compassionate, understanding.   The time finally arrived to say those life altering words. A month after She started staying over, we were lying in bed talking and She rolled over and whispered in my ear, a sweet, hushed  I love you.  I melted inside and wrapped my arms around Her and said it back, every cell in my body relieved I could finally safely say those words. The kiss we shared after was the most passionate, loving kiss I've ever experienced. That night shifted our relationship onto a new loving trajectory.   Months of our relationship growing followed.  She would stay at my place and we would cook dinner together, go out, enjoy our time together. But after every weekend She would go home and we both struggled with that time apart.   A decision was made.  Now, we live together.  I sold my house and moved into Hers and we are building the life we both want.  She wears the engagement ring I got Her with a giddy happiness, staring at it from time to time, and smiling.  The love we share is wholesome and invigorating.  Neither one of us ever anticipated this kind of love to return to us,  but it has and neither one of us are letting it go. She has always been my one true love and it was only a matter of time until She was back in my arms, my life, my heart.",1

I started to realize that, since I was a child, I have the bad habit of obsessing about girls. I like them and I can't stop thinking about them, it doesn't happen with all the girls I know, of course, but the ones I really like. It happens that I like them and I develop obsessions towards them. It's not that I spy on them or stalk them or something more disturbing, I'm not that bad in the head, it just happens in my head.  They live in my head. I idealize them. I am able to develop exclusivities and stop giving opportunities to other people for this reason.   It is happening to me now with a friend of my friend, I met her recently, we have some things in common, and we have even talked a little, but in my head I have already invented a whole story, and now she lives in my head.   This clearly makes me feel bad because from inside I hope it works out but most of the time it does not. I don't really know what's wrong with me or what's going on in my head. I think I have too much idealized the concept of relationships. Which leads me to develop these obsessions with possible girls who could be with me.  I don't know if this is the right subreddit to post this, but I could really benefit from hearing other people's opinions. I haven't really told anyone about this problem, although I think some friends realize how I tend to obsess sometimes.",1

Loved ones suggested online dating as a way to meet new people and “distract myself.” I found an amazing guy that had a lot of potential but I was absolutely not ready to date and I sadly messed things up. I regret it but I see it as part of my journey to healing.   After that, it was nothing but situationships and wild nights with guys I never planned to see again. I would think about some of these guys as potential partners but I came in like a wrecking ball. Nothing made me nervous and I came in with bad bitch energy. I went through some crazy experiences. I don’t regret any of it because I learned a lot about myself during this time.   After some deep self-reflection, I realized that I just needed to stop looking so hard. I reminded myself of the law of attraction and kind of let go of the idea of needing someone. I felt peace and realized how much I appreciated being on my own.   I met a guy that I instantly realized that I wanted to be with this guy forever. After the first 5 minutes, I knew this guy was special and that I did not want to do anything to mess this up. I let my feminine energy out and tucked away the masculine energy that I tend to give off. I didn’t want to do anything to lose this guy.   I never believed in true love and always thought people were being cheesy when they talked about seeing someone and knowing they wanted to marry that person. NOW, I know exactly what they were talking about. I’ve never connected with anyone like I do with him. I have deleted all of my dating apps and I think I’m in love. It’s so refreshing after so many odd dating experiences.   To the people that feel like they’ll never find true love, please be patient because the universe will give you exactly what you need at the right time and in the most unexpected way. Learn to love yourself. Work on healing past trauma or anything that can get in the way of a new relationship. Learn to verbalize exactly what you want out of a relationship. Be patient. Keep your standards high. Don’t build up walls and become cold hearted. You are enough. ❤️❤️❤️",1

A year ago I met Sara. She is super pretty and sweet so we started dating 4 months ago. Since then some things have bothered me.  She said she loved my  chocolate  skin which is just cringe. She doesnt understand sometimes when i complain about racism and never validates those experiences so i dont feel i can vent to her. All her celebrity crushes are white (or zendaya lol) .Idk if that me being insecure but i find it odd that none of her celebrity turn ons resemble me at all. Im brown. and more little things.  But the turning point was this christmas when i met her family- her little cousin said a racial slur and she didnt defend me or tell him off. she just said sorry to me in private and said she will talk to her aunt but never actually did.  its only been 4 months and I love her and we have future planned together. we have same friends and job. I dont know what to do. Sometimes i think dating white people is not a good idea for me and my childhood wounds.  Also let me add i dont think she is racist. she is very understanding when i explain things but its tiring to have to explain why some things are problematic.She super sweet and wouldnt wish anyone harm. But its harder that way bc she isnt full on racist she is just not anti-racist.  **TL;DR!** should i break up with my gf for not having experiences with black women? we love each other but there are just many things she doesnt understand or that i have to teach her.",1

I'm F38 and my partner is M34. We live together (for the past 2 years) with my two children (6 &13). I try to be a good partner, but I'm not sure what he needs. He has said frequently that he doesn't have a love language. I know what my love languages are (words and time), so it's easy for me to ask for what I need, and for him to know what to do. From the beginning of the relationship he has gone out of his way to be a good boyfriend and give me what I need. I only want to do the same for him. I would do anything for him, and I would love to give him what he needs. But according to him, he doesn't need anything. He enjoys physical connection but doesn't need it to feel loved. Words don't matter to him - I could go days without saying  I love you  or something loving and he wouldn't notice. Quality time isn't big for him because he likes space and solitude. Acts of service and gifts mean nothing to him. When we get into arguments, he frequently says  I do so much for you, but you do nothing for me in return  but when I ask him WHAT he wants from a partner (even in a quiet, calm moment), he cannot answer and just tells me he knows I love him. Since I don't know what he needs, I tend to love him in ALL languages to make sure I hit all the bases. And in return, I think it causes him to feel smothered. I want to do what's right for him, but I don't know what to do. Have you run across people with no love language? How do you love them the way they need?  Tldr: My partner doesn't have a love language and I'm not sure how to love him the way he needs.",1

We've been long distance on and off. Been friends with one of my best friends I will call Sarah since 10th grade of HS.      First off, I used to crush on Sarah back in HS. Turns out she did on me too but I found this out a little over a year ago (years after now) when she ended up suddenly single and decided to pursue things with me. Led to a long chat between us where I revealed I had had crush too. We decided to remain friends. She's a pretty woman and we have a lot in common but if things went wrong it would mean losing our friendship and a lot of others. She went on to find a great guy a month later anyway and they're still together.     Anyway, at that time I was in the talking phase with now GF. We would end up getting together over a week later after I asked GF out. Things have been overall great with some bumps because of the distance. Sarah and GF are also close friends and have become best friends themselves since we have been together too. Me and GF went long distance two months in after I had to relocate for a job assignment, but we have visited each other back and forth in the months since.      Two months ago, GF **told** me I had feelings for Sarah. Straight up told me that she knew I did the entire time. She knew about the conversation we had from Sarah and mentioned how I once said we would be together in another universe once when I told her about how our HS friends used to try to get us together. I denied her accusation. It was upsetting. It sounded like I was settling for her and waiting in the wings for a chance with Sarah like a hanger on guy. I am not that guy! Anyway, she said she accepted it, but flashforward to today.       We have plans to rent a place together in a new city. Keep in mind this was my idea, us living together because I want to spend the rest of my life with her. It happens that I picked this city both because it is a leader in my field, it is an amazing city, and of course because one of my best friends Sarah is there. I lucked out and am going to be working with Sarah too! I realize how lucky I am. I tell GF this today thinking she would be happy, and she tells me during the call,  I am preparing for when you fall back in love with her.      You can imagine I'm flabberghasted!!! I ask her what and she goes on to say she knows that us spending time together both at work and outside as friends one-on-one till she arrives will lead to my feelings being rekindled. I was too shocked to respond because I thought we had resolved this. She continued to lay out all of these reasons why she knew what would happen and how it was making her second guess relocating with me because she doesn't want to be my placeholder. I was too overwhelmed, so I was caught off guard when she said she didn't want to hear my response because either I would be lying to her or lying to myself and she hung up.      Reddit, I am confused! What do I do here? I have been nothing but honest with GF throughout the relationship even when it has been harsh. I have told her I am fully in love with her after some early doubts that she had too. Me and best friend do not do anything inappropriate either. Hell Sarah is in a relationship and I am happy for her to finally have a decent bf! GF says I'm lying to myself, but I do not think so. Am I missing some boundaries here?       **TL;DR: Moving to new city with LDR GF, female best friend Sarah will be there and I will be working with her too. Because of past crush, GF convinced I will fall in love with Sarah and use her as a placeholder because Sarah is unavailable and I am scared to lose her in my life. But I do not want to be with Sarah!**",1

There isn't much that I do with my partner that I'd be against doing with a very close friend.

But I do need to figure this out.  The two people involved are me 20M and my girlfriend, 20F   My girlfriend and I have been amazing the past couple months. The relationship is amazing. Her and I were friends for 7 years before we started dating, so we already had a fairly strong base in knowing each other. I love her. And I want to be better.   One of the ways I just express love and feel love is through touch. I sit down next to her, and I’ll just put my arm around her without thinking. I like to cuddle, just being near her. I love just spending time with her too. We play videogames together, go on walks, sit and just talk, go on bike rides, go to the gym, there are so many more things her and I do together than just sit and cuddle. And I am alright with that! I love doing all those things with her.   I know she just likes her personal space sometimes, and I try my best to respect that. It’s still fairly difficult for me because she is just someone I trust completely. I just feel a level of comfort around her that just isn’t the same with anyone else. None of that excuses me being too “cuddly”, so I ask y’all’s.  I know this isn’t a fair way to look at the situation, but the back of my mind always want me to just say “well you get cuddles whenever you want, but I can’t ever get cuddles even on days I need it”. Again, this is a terrible way of looking at it, and it isn’t fair to her cause I imagine if I needed personal space she would give it to me.   How have some of you all dealt with this? I don’t know if I am the only one. I probably just need to “man up” and deal with it. I want to respect her boundaries. I don’t want to mess up the best thing I have. I just don’t know where to effectively begin to change the crappy way my mind thinks.  Thanks",1

I'm EM, he's surgery. We started dating our first year of medical school, so we've been together for about 5 years now. I love him, but I don't like him very much. We are such different people with different values, different interests, different visions for our lives. For example, although he's excellent at it, he hates medicine. He's only in it for the money and prestige. That's fine, ppl do it for different reasons. However, it bothers me,  because I never did it for the money, but because I genuinely love it. He loves traveling to resorts, I prefer going on medical mission trips. He prefers mingling with ppl at fancy parties, I prefer disappearing and going hiking or mountain climbing. He is solely focused on his career, while I want to do things outside medicine as well. He wants marriage & kids asap, I want to wait. He doesn't believe in God, I do. And he he genuinely thinks he's a hotshot doc (unlike me) and acts like it. While we were in medical school, it didn't bother me as much as it does now. We were so busy studying, there was no time to think about my future with him. But now that I have a bit more time, I caught myself thinking that I don't want him to be the father of my children. I don't want them to be like him. I tried talking to him about all this, suggested therapy, but he is so dismissive, thinks I'm overthinking, said no to therapy. I suggested we take a break from each other, but he said not to even joke like that, that he loves me and needs me and that a break would kill him. He's in a very rigorous program, under a lot of stress and I don't want to add to that stress. How do I walk away from him without breaking him? Also, I still love him. Gosh, I love him so, so much. But in our case, love may not be enough.  How come I don't see most of the comments? Is there an argument going on btw two ppl? lol  Anyway, I realize how stupid this post it. And I know what to do.

Thought I’d share here.  At times, in family, when you see, people have certain wrong habits, and you can do nothing about it, because they don’t want to listen to you at all. What do you do ? By wrong habits, I mean the obvious wrong habits of having only junk most of time and not having home-cooked food, looking at their phone screens in dark room all night long, their anxious behaviour which they have accepted saying anxiety is natural in this fast-paced world to be more  productive , while you know inside, that fast-paced world requires even more balance within, in both mind & body, and “never” anxiety.  Since, I am someone, who has now taken to healthy lifestyle including a few meditations, because when I look around, I see how people are a slave to their bodies and mind, they have diseases long before they even hit their so-called old-age.  Can we do anything about it ? We just have to see them, doing all this, right ?  At this time, I can only remember this quote by Sadhguru:  If someone is nasty to you, first try love. If that does not work, compassion. If that does not work, distance.   And I have started following this… “distance”, though within, I sincerely hope, may they know the right & wrong for them.

Shortly after he was born, my girlfriends parents (we live with them) decided to move 400 miles away from my home town, so we followed, since then things have took a bit of a turn.  A week before the move she broke up with me, her reasoning was that she started looking at other boys in a romantic way, hadn't acted on it, but just wanted to be honest that she wasn't 100% focused on me, fair enough, I just took it for what it was and moved back to my mums house... until 2 days before the move where she said she regretted leaving me and begged me to move with them so I can be with her and my son. After a lot of back and forth I agreed as I want to be a big part of my sons life, just like my dad was in mine.  The first couple of months after the move were fine, everything was how I hoped it would be and I truly believed the breakup was just a small bump in our relationship, however this all seems to have changed over the last 6 months or so.  We no longer have sex, on her part, not mine, when I ask why she doesn't really have a reason, just says she's not interested in it anymore, which is fair enough if she feels that way, but I feel like she's just avoiding telling me that it's because she isn't in love anymore.  We do argue over small things, I couldn't even give an example as they're so insignificant, but it just feels like her temper (and probably mine) is a lot shorter than it was before the move, I also often feel that when being asked to do something like help out with our son, make her a drink etc it feels as if she is barking orders at me rather than asking nicely, which her family have pulled her up on multiple times, and she just laughs about it.  We have discussed breaking up a few times over the past few months due to the current state of our relationship, however I really want to push for it to work as I do not have the income to purchase/rent somewhere to live on my own up here, and all my family and friends are 400 miles away, meaning I will lose a lot of contact with my son. I also still believe we can get back to being what we used to be, however I'm starting to look at things logically and I'm not sure how long I can hang on and wait for things to repair themselves as it is really taking its toll on my mental health.  I understand that having a child can put a lot of stress on a relationship and really is a make or break situation, however I'm under the impression that this is completely unrelated, she does not have PPD or anything or that sort, and he is a really chilled baby, so not too much stress added from that side of things. Things were also fine before the breakup & move.  I do honestly feel like we both love eachother still, however I can only ever be sure on my side of it, but we do still share laughs and have a good time, it's not all doom and gloom.  There's probably other stuff I've missed/forgotten but that is the main idea of it.  What do you guys think I should do?  (Throwaway as she uses reddit)  Edit: fixed formatting",1

We’re pretty opposite in every sense of the word and balance each other well because of it, so its been easy for us to just talk any time something like that comes up.

This has been my first healthy, adult relationship so all of this in general has been very new for me anyways. Since we’re opposite, it’s been some hard work to learn each others love languages. All this to say, I have no doubt that this is something we can get passed and work through. For me though, I keep getting in my head about this phase ending, just because it just feels so off. Every little thing he’s been doing I have been reading too much into. For someone who has bad anxiety, it’s hard to tell when something is a gut feeling or me over thinking something. Please tell me I’m not the only one who has gone through these feelings and what would you say is a good way to help him understand where I’m coming from without trying to micromanage everything in the relationship?

My girlfriend is a keen reader (as am I) and we’re involved with circles who are also bookish and work in publishing, journalism and academia.  Over the last few months my girlfriend has been reading a semi-local author, a guy in his early thirties who has published two books. They’ve both been pretty well received and have won awards. I’ve never read either of them. I met the author at a party 4 years ago when his first novel was being released. I wasn’t very impressed with him, he seemed hungry for attention and not very serious, and was basically flirting with everybody. I’m not just saying that because of what happened either.   A while after this party I found out my ex girlfriend had been sleeping with him. She was a sweetheart of mine from school and talked about marriage and a future together frequently. We had been together 7 years in total and took each other’s virginity, I thought she was the love of my life. So naturally this completely shattered me. She begged me to forgive her but I couldn’t and we parted ways. She didn’t carry a relationship on with the author from what I hear.  I was majorly depressed and suicidal but dug my way out of it and fell in love with my current gf who is a high school English teacher. I feel happier with her than ever.  Cut to now. This guys second book came out a while ago and one day I found my current gf reading it. I asked her about it and she was gushing about how incredible and well written it was. Obviously I didn’t like that but I didn’t want to say what had happened and reasoned she wasn’t doing anything wrong so I dropped it.  After that she read his first book. And has since reread both. She recommends his books to everyone and gets them as gifts. She goes on about how she loves the guys writing, how it feels like he’s speaking directly to her, how the author must have such a deep heart and thinks so deeply about the human condition and all this stuff.   Every compliment to him is a dagger in my heart.  A book to me is something very personal. Someone has poured themselves into creating something. For her to love his ideas is like her loving a part of him and I can’t stand it. I am anxious and have had panic attacks. Worse still, he is doing a book signing soon that she wants to go to.   How do I approach this? Do I make peace with it, do I ask her to stop reading him (if she does I’ll always know her real feelings), do I ask her not to go to the book signing or do I let her go alone, I have no idea how to handle this",1

I am just a suffering being too, though, and I certainly didn’t choose to love someone I can’t have.   So what did you learn from your situation if you had a similar one?

Right now I'm feeling mentally, emotionally and physically exhausted; we recently had a fight (I'm not sure it can really be classified as that) where he took my quietness as a slight against him and proceeded to give me the cold shoulder. Afterwards we had a really good conversation about expectations and how actions have been making us feel and agreed to communicate better as I suggested that if this was how it was going to be I couldn't continue.  But now after the conversation I'm left feeling unsure, I do love him and I enjoy being around him; but when I'm away I don't feel the urge to get back to him, I think I feel more obligated to get back, like 'oh we're dating I better spend some time with him'. Of the time we've been living together he's been unemployed and looking for work for 70% of it, eating into his savings to pay his portion of the bills. Looking at my future goals, they really wouldn't be impacted either way, I am self-sufficient as I don't really feel that I can rely on him. And now I'm thinking why am I with him, is it because I do want to spend my life with him, or is it because I've fallen into into routine.  Should I have the hard conversation, or wait out my current low moment and see how I feel?  TL;DR -  After 5 years I'm questioning my relationship, is it routine or just a low moment?",1

(28m). We have a daughter together. Things have been mostly great between us, but in the last year my wife has been a bit off. We haven't been arguing or anything like that, but she has just seemed a bit withdrawn or distracted. Initially I thought she was just stressed out from work and have tried talking to her to see if she's okay, but she insists she is fine and nothing is wrong. I started to get paranoid that she was cheating even though I had no solid proof. So I decided to snoop on her phone. I know I shouldn't have done it but I had to know and didn't want to be a played a fool. Instead I realized she wasn't being unfaithful at all. I found that she had multiple secret fake accounts on various platforms, where she was pretending to be a man, and part of very racist and anti semitic communities. She was very active, posting and commenting very hateful things about other races but mostly about jews. I also saw she had become online friends with hundreds of people who believed and posted the same things as she did. I couldn't believe my eyes. She has never showed signs of being a racist or ever been a political person. She was just an easygoing, happy, loving woman that enjoyed reading and gardening. Now she's a full blown extremist. I don't know how she got caught up with this crap, though I suspect she was brainwashed by others online. At this point, I feel like our marriage and entire relationship is a lie. She is not who I thought she was. She is leading a double life and most importantly I'm afraid for our daughter. I don't want my daughter subscribing to such ideologies. I love her but I don't think it's gonna work if this who she really is. I don't know what to do. What would you do if it was you?",1

We recently became friends in January of this year through Tinder. I was looking for something more romantic on there and was honestly just swiping and I swiped right on her without reading her bio. I know that's dumb but I was bored. We ended up matching and I was in complete shock because she is drop dead gorgeous. I was honestly scared to message her because I thought it was an accident because she is way out of my league. She ended up messaging me first and I was shocked but over the moon. I went and read her bio just so that I could have an idea of what I was getting into. In her bio it said that she was just looking for friends, I was a little sad but I'm always happy to make new friends so I just went along as friends.   We got really close really fast and I've been there for her throughout a lot of the shit she's been going through over the past couple months. I started spending some nights at her house with her and it's gotten to the point where she's my ride or die and we've discussed possibly moving in together.  Well through all of this I've been falling deeply in love with her and I don't know if she feels the same. I have some past trauma from friends and stuff like this where I accidentally start to like them romantically and I tell them and then years down the line it gets thrown in my face.   I'm very confused and scared. I want to tell her and maybe see if it turns into anything but with everything she's had going on I don't want to burden her and I also don't want to lose her as a friend if I tell her how I feel.   I don't know what to do. My other friends are saying I need to tell her and they think she likes me too but I can't tell if it's wishful thinking or actually there.  Should I talk to her and tell her how I feel? Or should I just wait and see if she makes a move of some kind?

We met through a mutual friend and she fell madly in love with me although I didnt seem to care that much for her at that time. We were in that situationship for around 2 months and then I broke things off. We started hanging out again around 1 year later and both fell in love  and everything was great up until recently. She started to avoid physical intimacy in all ways not just sex(she would just give me pecks and wouldnt kiss me for longer than a second and told me to move whenever I got close to her) and I gave it time because I understand that there can be a period where she just wants to be a little distant. Yesterday (after 2 months of no physical intimacy) I confronted her and told her that I love her but that I cant do this forever and that I need physical intimacy in the relationship. She told me that she realizes that but that she avoids the topic whenever it comes up. She said that she just doesnt have a libido anymore or any will for being physically closer. We didnt argue and we had a good civil conversation about it. Then she told me that she realized that the only times she feels excited about our relationship is when she thinks about us at 15 when I was rejecting her and that I was the only male to ever reject her. Also she said that we should try out new dates because she doesnt remember much sweet memories of us from the past 3 months. I agreed on the new dates thing but the thing is, I have been always pushing for new dates while she always declines them because of something (If I recommend going  for a swim at night she says that she is too fat, if I recommend a cool new place that opened up she says that it is too fancy and that we will be laughed at there). This brought me concern and I have been thinking is she just in love with the memories of me from the past? Ever since the issues started I have been trying to be better to her in every way but it just didnt seem to work. I want to be the best man possible for her and I am willing to do anything for her but I just dont know what to do anymore. I am so so afraid that she is just in love with the memories and not me, what do I do?",1

I barely even get to communicate with him when we’re apart. I told him that I think he should come and visit me too seem as though it’s an hours drive for me to and from every time that I go. Also, the gesture of him coming to me would be nice. He told me that he doesn’t really like coming to my house because there’s less to do and he just doesn’t really want to spend the gas money since he works 30 minutes away every day anyways.  This is the thing. We see each-other every OTHER weekend, so basically for one full weekend every 2 weeks. So as you can tell, most of our communication and bonding should take place over the phone in the meantime until we can see each-other next. Here’s the issue. He gets off of work at 1pm. I start my job at 7pm. So there’s a 6 hour window of open communication for us, PLUS he can text me while I’m at work since my job isn’t very demanding. We’re allowed to use our phones when there’s no clients around and all of our work is done.   For him, he sees his time as spending it how he wants independently. The. Entire. Day. Every. Day. He says it’s healthy and how it should be, but it’s almost as if he just forgets about me or ignores me for hours and hours. I don’t feel like an important part of his day like I should be, even if I am not physically with him. I should still be an important part of his day to nurture.   He does the same thing every day. He will get off of work and drive home listening to music. Valid. Even I do that, too. Then, he will go and talk to his parents/family for about an hour or longer over a beer, then might go out for a ride on his motorcycle with one of his friends for an hour or two. Then he will come home, shower and watch some TikTok’s, maybe talk to his parents again or start playing some Xbox. All before even acknowledging or answering ANY of my texts for the entire day. Sometimes he does send me a Goodmorning text, but my response to that is probably not going to be responded to until hours and hours later. I leave for work at 6:40pm, so when he ends up having some spare time to his name, he will then call me at maybe like 5:45 or 6:00pm. But our call is basically him talking to me and multi-tasking either playing Xbox or whatever it may be. Then, our call will get interrupted by his dinner being ready, so he will go away for like 40 minutes and eat and talk to his parents some more. By that time, I’m basically at work and can’t answer his call since he leaves it for last minute every single day. Then, I tell him that since we don’t really get to talk much, he can feel free to text me at work until he goes to sleep. He doesn’t text me. He might answer my text once before bed, but I will go hours without hearing anything until then. I just feel like a spare-time *friend* to him. I don’t really feel like a fiancé. I don’t feel like I’m an important part of his day at all. He also doesn’t cuddle me as much, barely dishes out a compliment to me, doesn’t hug me unless I’m coming or going, and barely even wants to do the deed with me anymore.   He calls it “me time” and says that it’s not a bad thing. He also said “We’re just at that point in the relationship where it’s a *different* kind of love. We already got past the lovey-dovey stage where all we want to do is kiss and cuddle and compliment each-other, so now we’re at that stage where we just kiss less, don’t hug as much, don’t compliment as much, and that’s okay! If anything, I love you more now and it’s a mature kind of love!” I still like to compliment him all the time, kiss him a lot, get hugs and things like that, so it’s definitely just him who is “at this stage”. Not me. He said he will come over this weekend because he knows I’m bummed that he doesn’t.   He also called me for an hour today, but of course was playing Xbox for some of that, and then told me his friend invited him to an Xbox game and he told him he would play, so he basically hung up after an hour of talking to me. His friends are always playing Xbox with him almost every night. I feel like instead of cutting time off of playing with his friends/playing with them later, he instead cuts our call short to play games with them.   So to sum that up: (TL;DR!) He will not (or barely) answer any of my texts the whole day until maybe an hour before I go to work. He does everything he wants before even acknowledging any messages of mine, and then will call me for maybe 30 minutes while playing Xbox. I’ll tell him he can text me instead while I’m at work, and he won’t. He might text me one message when he goes to bed, but not before that at all. Since we only see each-other every other weekend (I only go to his house), our main form of communication relies on the phone. I barely even get to talk to him in a day. I feel like he prioritizes everything he wants to do/everyone else in his life before me, and then finally talks to me during his spare time. He said “we’re just at that stage where we don’t want to kiss as much, don’t hug as often and don’t really compliment each-other that much and that’s ok.” But I still do all of those things. So it’s just him who’s at that stage.   Advice on how to get through this “stage” of his??",1

Wife was never very supportive of my mental health struggles. she thinks I am being insecure. She mostly doesn't want to hear it and when I finally do confide in her about something, she will tell me I need to be more medicated or to see a therapist. She has gotten way worse lately. She has also used personal things that I told her against me when we fight. She has said some pretty awful stuff during fights, mostly about our intimate life. She has compared me negatively to her ex husband. She seems to not care if she hurts me or not. She never apologizes for what she says. Out bedroom life has also vanished. We have had sex maybe 2 times in the last few months and both times she said 'its for you and not for me.  Our communication has also been struggling. She will actively interrupt me when trying to talk to her and not apologize. She also will just stare at her phone when I try and talk to her. I've tried to talk to her and see if something is bothering her. She always turns it around on me and makes me feel like I am the bad guy. I end up apologizing and not getting to talk about what I needed to. I don't want to lose my wife but I'm starting to believe she does not love me anymore.

I’m dating a man who goes above and beyond for me, and I adore every minute of it. From what I’ve heard from his friends and family (and sometimes from him too) is that they’ve never seen him act that way before, give so much, be so affectionate, and show up the way he does for me.  On one hand, it’s flattering! On the other hand, it’s a little red flaggy to me that he wasn’t a great partner to his past girlfriends.  His kindness, protection and care seem compulsory to me, not forced or fake. It’s as if he can’t help it and I looove it!  Men (especially over 40), was there a build up to maturity that led you to be better to one and not previous partners? Was there a level of emotion you hadn’t previously felt? Why would you make serious changes for one and not others? Did the sense of loss from another great love make you want to do better next time, even if the feelings aren’t as strong for the current one?  I know people come into their own and learn from mistakes at different points in their lives, so NO judgement here! Just curious to know what goes on in those masculine noggins of yours.",1

She has assured me that everything is going to be ok as the colleges are less than 2 hours apart, but something tells me otherwise. I feel as if we are slowly going to go our separate ways as she meets new people and stops seeing me on a near daily basis. I feel like eventually she'll meet some guy she finds attractive and loose feelings for me. It kills me, it absolutely kills me to be thinking this way, but I think, and my dad thinks I should break it off. I really dont want to, and maybe I'm making a mistake by even running these thoughts. Her parents love me, she loves me, I love her. She thinks we'll last, but I dont seem to think so. My logic is to break things off right now that way it doesn't hurt as much later, I already think life would be hard without her, but I want to prevent any further attachment before I potentially hurt myself if we dont last. I just need some advice as to what I should do in this situation, please.  TL;DR: Should I break up with the girl I love because we're going to schools less than 2 hours away from each other?",1

We've been together for a good few years now and have been looking forward to settling down.   At the same time, I found myself having a work crush. I'm ashamed of it but after developing these feelings, I started to view my girlfriend in a less positive light. Things I didn't use to care about started becoming obvious to me. My girlfriend's weight gain, her bad habits, and I've stopped finding her physically attractive. (On that note: I still find my girlfriend adorable - but more like a cute child than a beautiful woman if you catch my drift).  I still love the time i spend with my girlfriend but i find myself not craving her presence when we're apart. On the other hand I think about my crush.. a lot. I'm disgusted by my own behaviour but what does this mean?Am I not ready to settle down? Am I a chauvinist pig who only cares about looks? Do I want/need more sexual experience before committing? A combination of all?  I've been struggling with these feelings for a few months and I don't know what to do. Whenever I've considered breaking up with my girlfriend in the past I've always decided against it to protect her well-being, and then our relationship does get better. So maybe this is just a phase I have to knuckle down and get through.  Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!",1

[17M]  [16F] This relationship I have had with the person has tested me mentally very harshly and I am unsure how to go about my situation. Its a long story so please be patient. 5 years ago I met this wonderful girl and we seemed to just always get along and stay on the same wavelength, we spoke for ages and then I finally built up the courage to ask her out in march 2020. From there we were really happy and enjoying each others company experiencing young love as everyone should. Then covid happend and lock down struck. I think that was a tough time for alot of people's relationships. For me and this girl we managed to get through the first few months together but then I don't know why but I broke things off. Now when I look back on it I realised I always did love her even when I broke things off with her I think I was just bored (well thats just the excuse I give to myself to make me feel better). Fast foward to 2021, another lock down came. I reached out to contact her and we spoke for a little bit. However, then came one of the darkest points of my life. I remember it so vividly, I was down in the kitchen making a drink when I got 3 consecutive messages from 3 different guys (2 of them being my best mates) all of them told me to leave her alone as I was annoying her and she didn't want me at all. That shook me to the core. Only one person told me they loved me that day and that was because I gave then answers to the history homework. That was one of the hardest points of my life. After them messages I stopped messaging her as I was told not to. 2 weeks later she messages me and says,  hey how have you been do you want to come and play some minecraft  so being the young in love boy I was I agreed and did so. We chatted for a bit here and there after when it all happened again except this time it was more aggressive threats. I got messaged from one of my friends to basically fuck off and leave her alone as it is literal harassment at this point. It was at that point I knew it was over between me and this girl. Exactly one year later in 2022 I go to my first ever party. She was there. I didn't speak to her and just avoided her it wasn't until our groups were socialising we spoke again. The next day we messaged and then started to get close once again. I fell further in love with her and developed attachment issues. It was on the run up to our exams so we decided not to take things further until after them. Towards the end of exams I could sense she was loosing interest so became desperate to try and keep her which only made things worse. Then once the exams were over I found out she was with another guy at the same party I was at which broke me. Then I found out she got back with her ex she dated in 2021. I was so mentally challenged in that time. I didn't speak speak anyone about it I got through it by myself battling my own thoughts. I went on holiday in that summer and realised I didn't need her and felt over her. After I was over her I thought it would be best to message her acknowledging things were over and just thank her for the fun times we had that year just to keep things respectful and finish on a good note.  Now this year 2023 I don't know how but she found a way to get back into my life again. We started talking around 4 weeks ago when we ecounted each other in college for the first time in months. She came round my house and we were chill and everything. Fast foward 2 days later we were at the party like chilling together cuddling etc and then one of my friends comes over and starts talking to her, he walks out with her and then made out with her. I was so angry I could have killed him and her there and then. Later that evening me and her went outside because I asked to speak to her about things which was when I asked why she done it etc. She told me me she's drunk she doesn't think properly and is a more of a why not person without thinking of the consequences and feels really guilty now. We spoke about our past and she admitted she had been awful to me. I even said I was planning on asking her out but that is most likely not going to happen now after this. She told me she really liked me and did love me but said that I was very mature compared to her and she was immature. She said she felt guilty for what she done earlier that night.  She also said that what I'm looking for is different to what she is. All the time she was hugging me while we were talking about everything that happened. This has been the only girl I have ever truly loved and it feels like she will be the only one I ever will. It feels to me as if i am with her or alone in life because she means that much too me. Both my friend and her have apologised to me and both have said they feel really bad. What should I do this whole situation hurts me as I like her so much. Please give me advice  TLDR: I met this girl 5 odd years ago and ever since we have had a thing on and off. However the last 3 years have been very toxic and difficult for me to process because I love her that much. We dated at one point and broke up.  2020: Dated 2021: Spoke things got toxic I got sent threats from friends to leave her alone 2022: Started talking again said we were going to take things further but she ghosted me and got back with her ex from 2021 2023: We started taking things seriously then she got with my friend in front of me and then we spoke about it after. She claimed to be immature",1

We had always been a bit uneven in how we split housework and chores because he works a schedule with odd hours. I’m also a total neat freak, so when I did extra cleaning and chores I knew that was my need more than his. Still, we were super happy and I was very content in my marriage.   Then, when our oldest daughter was born, I realized that I was struggling with doing a larger share of housework and a larger share of baby duties. He did some, but it was definitely still very skewed such that I did way more work than he did and I was getting really burned out.  We had our second daughter 2.5 years later and things still didn’t change. It was still really skewed towards me doing more, and I was getting really burned out really fast.   Then the pandemic hit. I got laid off and started a side hustle from home, which was going pretty well but still allowed me the time I needed for our girls. But my husband really struggled. His work changed his title and responsibilities when he started working from home, his hours changed, and he started to be home with me and the girls a LOT more than he had in the past.   He started to withdraw from us HARD. He is a gamer and already spent a lot of time gaming with his friends online before then, but when the pandemic started he withdrew from them and just started playing solo games. He started staying up really late at night - midnight, 1, 2, sometimes later - and would really struggle in the mornings with our youngest while I drove our older daughter to preschool.   He told me he was depressed and struggling. He formed new online friends and spent hours every day playing with them. He’d often start a game right before dinner and miss meals with us. He’d be grumpy when he couldn’t game late at night, or be super grumpy if he needed to wake up with the kids. I started handling most morning duties so he could sleep in, and I pretty much took on the majority of childcare. I was also still running my website and taking care of the house. He was pretty “lost.”  I tried to be really patient and give him a lot of grace because he was struggling with depression. But he was getting tons of time for gaming and getting plenty of sleep each day while I was barely getting by.   Both our girls are older now and my youngest starts school in a few months. He seems to be wanting a lot more involvement with our girls, and he seems to be helping around the house more. Things are slowly getting better. We are still not sharing the load evenly, but things are way better than they were before.   My problem now is that I’m not sure I love him anymore. I felt really abandoned when he leaned so hard into his gamer friends and pulled back so hard from me and left me to do so much parenting by myself. I was working a new “job”  and still making money for our family (which I don’t work anymore, I got hired back at my old job last year). I was exhausted all the time and he was really grumpy a lot of the time about his gaming.   We started fighting a lot and we haven’t stopped. He keeps saying how he is so stressed out with our girls that he needs his gaming to “get himself back.” I keep trying to find a way to share the load together around the house and with the kids so I don’t totally shrivel up like a raisin and want to cry.   He is trying harder now, but I just don’t have the heart for this. I want to give him time to heal. I struggled with depression when I was in college and I know how it feels. I wanted to give him space to work things out and come back to me and to our girls. But he is still struggling so much and I’m feeling so many negative thoughts. I feel abandoned. Lonely. Overwhelmed. Stressed. Scared. I don’t want to leave him - I want to go back to our happy times before our girls were born. But I don’t feel the love for him that I used to.   We tried seeing a marriage therapist, but that got too expensive and didn’t seem to be working for us anyway.   I don’t want to hear about his gaming. I don’t want to talk about his online friends. I don’t want to keep telling him how much this is weighing on me and feeling like it doesn’t matter. I don’t want to have sex, I don’t want to spend time with him, and I’m Not enjoying his company anymore.   We aren’t romantic at all anymore. We struggle to find things to talk about, we don’t kiss often or hug often anymore, and sex is really infrequent. We are more like roommates with benefits than a married couple these days.   Is it possible to fix this? Can I get to a point where this relationship is a healthy model for my girls?   I’m wondering if we should find a new counselor, or take some time apart, or if maybe this is beyond fixing?  If anyone has had a similar experience I would love to hear about what you tried, what worked or what didn’t work, and learn more.   TL;DR- Can i fall in love with my husband again if I feel like I don’t love him anymore after a change in our relationship?",1

Met someone out last week and got on really well, told them from my side it was very casual as I’m only in town for the next 2 weeks. Went home with him and I invited him on a night out this week - he asked me a couple of times if he could take me out which I replied the only day I could do. He was very forward (which I liked). He gave me his number and I left it a couple of days and messaged him before the night out. He came with his friend and we got together again, except I wanted to go home and he kept saying he couldn’t leave with me as he had his flatmates keys. There were so many ways round this I.e I could have gone back with him and we could have let his flatmate in etc but I didn’t want to explicitly invite myself over. He phoned me when I got home and kept saying how it was so nice to see me, and kept saying he was so keen to go on this date, being really forward and flirty. Fast forward 2 days there’s no reply from my last message so I just message and say are you still on for tonight? He replied saying “I’m unwell so I don’t think I’ll be leaving my bed anytime soon. Sorry x”   I very much took that as a “I’m not interested anymore” as he didn’t reschedule another day.   But it’s left me so confused and slightly upset - I would have understood if he wasn’t so love bomby in the first place like saying “I hope you come down to xyz to see me” “let’s go out on thurs I’ll give you a time and place” and just being so complimentary. To me it felt very genuine and I feel like I usually have a good judge of character and can usually see right through people so I’m hurt and as much as I don’t want to take it personally, I really am.

Lately, I’ve become more aware of the reality that I don’t like the way my GF treats other people. I was hoping you could help me find out how to address this issue. Skip the Background if you desire.  **Background**  My GF suffers from consistent anxiety and other mental health struggles which may be rooted in trauma. Her father passed away when she was a baby and she was raised by her grieving single mom. She often had to be an emotional caretaker for her widowed mother whilst grieving her own father herself. Because of this experience, she learned to take full responsibility for her own life. She is assertive, confident and always puts in her very best effort to achieve her goals because she has always felt like she only has herself to count on. But, as a result she is really hard on herself. I can tell that she carries a lot of pain and instead of processing it she tries to cover it up by trying her best to make the right decisions. I’ve seen glimpses of that inner child hurting and I’ve felt such pure love for her — I just want her to feel better. She deserves that because she’s an innocent and beautiful human.  I love her. She loves me and takes care of me. We have lots of fun and work together in many ways. She is a highly respectable, admirable and inspiring young woman.  However, her behavioural patterns are starting to take a toll on me.  She doesn’t like sharing her pain very often because she feels like she is burdening others with her feelings. This applies to me. While we do share our emotions and struggles, this block has always made me feel like our emotional convos don’t go as deep as they do with other people in my life. This makes me feel lonely because I can’t express myself and feel fully open with my partner which is a huge need for me. Holding in her pain has also manifested as anger, anxiety and depression which she has struggled with at times. She has also smoked weed everyday for like 7 years. She is a very functional stoner and uses it for migraines/head aches but I’ve recently become concerned that she’s just blocking her own emotions and using it to cope.   **The Problem**  I feel like she can be very critical, uptight and rude with other people. Because of her A-type personality, she has very high expectations and standards for others. These range from how often people should reach out, how punctual they should be and what their life decisions and opinions are. Normally, this is a good thing because it filters BS people out of your life. But I also feel like she comes off as a strict, particular and disagreeable type of friend. I totally support having high standards but when you push these expectations onto people it pushes people away. She has subtle conflict with a lot of different people in her life. She’ll complain or talk shit about various relationships with relative frequency. And on the other hand, multiple people have told me that they feel like they have to walk on eggshells around my girlfriend. They don’t wanna say or do the wrong thing. She can be very opinionated so you don’t wanna say something too controversial. She can also be pretty blunt with comments she makes — she’s not always the most tactful. She also has a lot of anxiety so sometimes she will get very stressed out over seemingly small things.   For example, the other day my sister was borrowing these branded jeans that my girlfriend had purchased from a thrift store. On the day my sister was supposed to return them, she accidentally ripped a small hole in the jeans. She obviously felt terribly, but more concerningly,  she later told me also felt kind of terrified about how my GF would react. I started thinking about how I too have felt that same fear. Other friends don’t invoke that fear. Its not normal. My sister decided to instantly send her the money to replace the jeans and then apologize for it in person. So they meet up and my sister explains why she sent the money and explained + apologized for what happened.  Even though my sister handled everything well my GF had a mini panic attack and quote “needed to sit down because these kinds of things really stress me out” followed by “By the way, this is the most grace that I have ever given anybody when it comes to my belongings being damaged”. Like I get that its stressful, but the money was already sent to you and THIS is the most grace you can give? Not a lot of grace IMO. You could have gone online and had the jeans at your door the next day. It seemed like over reaction in my opinion and I felt as though it really validated my sister’s fear of her reaction. This is the kind of thing that happens with other people too and it causes me a lot of stress because it might push people away. Some of these people are just her friends but many are also mine or our mutual friends and it leaves me feelings isolated and put in the middle of these people that I love.   When it comes to me, she is a lot more dialled in with this behaviour. We went through a really rough patch during the pandemic where she really treated me like shit in these ways but since then we’ve worked through a lot and she has put in a sincere effort to change and be better for me which  I really appreciate. Even though I’m still sometimes a victim of these patterns, I’m more concerned at how it pushes other people in our life away. I don’t get how to make her realize this OR whether I should see this as an incompatibility for the long term. Its almost been 6 years of us being together and she definitely is fully down to get married for life. While I love her so deeply and know that I should keep choosing to love everyday, the thought of being married still makes me feel anxious in general  because I feel like i’m still so young and I’m still growing. Last point, she is in therapy and anti depressants out of her own volition because even when it comes to that she’s Type A.  TLDR: My GF has trauma that has led to an abrasive personality. Despite having   many redeeming qualities, it is starting to take a toll on my mental health  **Edit:** Thank you everyone for your responses. The overwhelming consensus from people about this topic is well, a bit overwhelming to say the least, but also sobering and validating. I’m so grateful for all the diverse insights. I’m gonna respond to as many people as I can and then go off Reddit for a while to reflect on my next steps.",1

We started seeing each other in 2021, but only as friends with benefits. I was taking a gap year between undergrad and grad school, and was mostly looking for sex and friendship at the time. Over time, emotions grew and we started to feel more for each other. The big reasons why we didn’t initially get together is that I planned to either move abroad—I I’m a dual citizen in a European country—or to the Northern USA while she wanted to stay where we are. I also didn’t want kids while she did. The time came for me to move away to my hometown for grad school, but we felt the emotions grew too strong and we both loved each other so much. I had experiences our one initial year together that made me reconsider my stance on children, so we ended up getting together and going long distance for a year. We almost broke up once because I still felt desire to move, and she conceded that we could move out of state eventually and solidly said that she didn’t want to move abroad—which is 100% fair. Long distance continued until about a month ago, when I moved into her place. But lately, I’ve been feeling mixed emotions again.  One factor is that, I had to go back to an old, gap-year workplace until my new official job starts, and interacting with my old coworkers reminded me of who I once was and my old ambitions. All my old coworkers were asking me about my plans to move to abroad and things like that. I mostly just said I didn’t really want to do that anymore, but being asked got me thinking about it again. I don’t know if that is just a silly, unrealistic dream of a young person or if it’s something feasible that I should go for. I also don’t know if my wistful feelings are getting in the way of me being rational about the situation. I am a dual citizen of the country I planned on moving to, so it would be logistically easier than for most people. But on the other hand, is it realistic for me to be thinking about that goal? I wanted to leave this country because of political considerations, but I’m not sure if I’m just trying to escape problems rather than addressing them.    I also initially didn’t want kids but overtime grew to change that opinion. I’m solid in my change of opinion. I don’t think I’d mind having kids. But we have a three year age gap and so she really wants to start having them soon, with her being set in her career and ready to get married and settle down. She also has PCOS, which makes having children difficult and ups the pressure. She’s agreed that we wouldn’t start trying until we’re 30, which is honestly a huge sacrifice on her part—no denying that. If we broke up, I feel like I’d have wasted her time that she could have used having children.  The most important thing, of course, is that I’m in love with her and love being with her. I don’t know why I’m even thinking this stuff because I love doing things with her, I love living with her, I love having experiences with her or even doing nothing with her. I don’t get why I’m having these doubts at all, why I’m being selfish when she has sacrificed for me.  I’m writing this to get my thoughts written/typed out and maybe get some unbiased and blunt opinions. Sorry for the stream of consciousness.",1

I've been married for 4 years, but have been with my wife for 10, since I was 19.  Since we've been married, we have had sex only a handful of times. Often times it's months between. My wife is upset because I have an addiction to porn, I've been trying to quit and can go days, weeks at a time but her not sleeping with me during this makes it even harder to quit.  This morning she accused me of masturbating while I showered, I didn't. She then proceeded to ignore me the whole rest of the morning. I'm a firefighter and went on shift today, 24 hr shift. Before I left to work I vocalized that I was upset she was ignoring me before work, it blew up into a bigger argument and now she's saying she's leaving me, blocked my number.  I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm being deprived of an essential need, as a man. I don't want her to leave, it's not the first time she's threatened it. A couple years ago I was behaving in an unfaithful manner, I didn't sleep with anyone else but I was being flirtatious with another woman and hanged out with her. I've since repented and have not done anything like that since but she still hasn't truly forgiven me. We now have a small baby together and she has been pretty volatile after her pregnancy. I've tried my hardest to be patient and understanding with her but I'm constantly walking on eggshells. Everytime we argue, it's weeks before she'll even start thinking about having sex with me again. This is so hard to deal with. Im trying to quit porn, trying to not be lustful of any women but the longer I abstain from porn the more lustful I become. Sometime she'll say she's going to sleep with me  later in the day  but if I do anything that displeases her, she won't. I've currently gone 3 days without porn, which is pretty hard, and every night she's found a way out of sleeping with me. This morning she accused me of watching it but I 100% didn't and I just feel absolutely defeated. I'm a firefighter who just went on 24 hr shift today and she was arguing with me through text, said she was leaving me, blocked my phone and won't reply on any other messaging apps. I don't know what to do. Its not the first time she's threatened divorce but this time feels different. All of this is more complicated than what I've wrote so far but I'd probably have to write a fuckin novel to get everything in, lol. I just feel lost, defeated, demoralized and shameful.",1

This broke my heart into pieces. I am completely shattered and I donno whom to share this and find a solution.  I have always proven my love whenever there were hard times on him, I totally took care of him. But during my hard times he was not much available with me, just like a normal friend.

ThrowRA9090897,Update Post: Fiancé (27F) threatening to call of wedding if I (M26) don't let her parents (M57/F50) move in with us after the wedding.,1562,14bq14c,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14bq14c/update_post_fiancé_27f_threatening_to_call_of/,256,2023-06-17 12:33:50,relationship_advice,"This will be my only update post available for this subreddit, in the 48 hours since I've posted that thing took off like a rocket ship. I'd like to start off by thanking everyone for their opinions, while a majority of you told me to leave, others offered compromises, logical alternatives, and gave me questions I didn't even THINK to ask myself. I'll put a TLDR at the bottom, but I probably won't need it.      I think this has been the longest 48 hours of my life, reading through comments, responding to them, having meetings IRL, and talking with my Fiancé have REALLY given me clarity on what my next choices in life are going to be.      1 - I've postponed the wedding. While some of you may refer to it as 'calling her bluff,' I call it waiting and seeing. As of right now, we're REALLY talking about how compatible we truly are, going over our goals in life again, and talking in depth about the relationship we want with our inlaws if we got married apparently alot had changed since the last time we talked about it (before I got money, some of you called it).      2 - Yes, she genuinely thought moving her parents in would make my relationship with them better over time. I've expressed that as a result of all they've said/done to me any positive relationship or communication with them will only be done out of necessity. For example if she was pregnant, in the hospital, or any life altering complication or celebration. She did not take this well, but that  was expected, but it's important I tell my truth. She believes I'll come around, and try to build a relationship with her parents, but as of right now I can't see myself doing it.     3 - My Parents won't be moving in, as I haven't even asked them yet. I know some of you were confused/assumed it was already happening. It was not, I asked if it was okay if they could. Not TELLING her it was happening. Some of you suggested that maybe moving them in as newlyweds was weird, and suggested building them a small house on property. I didn't think about that, and will talk to my accountant/parents about it whenever that conversation needs to be talked about. Nice idea reddit strangers.      4 - What have I been doing? ALOT of meetings about my future, finances, and setting up trusts/wills. I'll be re-enrolling into school to take classes on business, finances, accounting, and economics as my accountant suggested I do. We're still working on a budget, but as of right now my next steps are furthering my education to manage my newfound wealth and opportunity in a healthy way as to not blow it.      As of right now, to be honest I'm emotionally drained. I think think the weight of my grandfathers death is finally hitting me despite it being months later, and the only thing that kept me going was the idea of the wedding day. With that being postponed, I can really only focus on myself, my values, and my emotions. Staying up all night and drinking at a grave site isn't healthy, and I've not only promised myself to cut back on the booze, but also not stay up drinking. I've been thinking about maybe getting into some sort of therapy/grief counselling, but I'd need to make sure that is in the budget with my accountant as that's a long term thing maybe they know someone.     5 - Couples Counselling. To those that suggested it, that's a wonderful idea. However, I'm not sure if I can move past her strange dependent relationship with her parents. Initially I thought I could, but with the 'rose tinted goggles' off I'm starting to see alot of redflags I'm not too confident a therapist/wedding can solve. We both have issues we need to work through, but right now I'm not sure if we'll be working through them together.      I know alot of you said to drop the relationship, but I think after six years it's worth giving it a try to save it. Making a choice like that without trying to fix the problem seems silly, but I did expect ALOT of those answers to come through it's just how reddit is. Just know that, I know my worth, I know my values, and I'm not backing down. Maybe we won't work things out, and the relationship will just end. Maybe things will work out, and we can continue. At least for now 48 hours later, it's too soon to tell.      6 - As for the prenup, we haven't signed anything yet. A lot of you were really harping on the 'nice ring, and fancy vacations' once a year thing. While the vacations compromise is indeed concerning, the ring issue is something we've been having conflict on for awhile. My personal opinion before/now is that rings are overpriced, silly, and serve no significant purpose in a relationship. She says that they're a important symbol of love/commitment. The compromise to the prenup in regards to the ring was, I actually buy her a 'better' ring than I already had. Which sounds super predatory in those words, but it makes sense in my mind. She doesn't want a 'titanic heart of the ocean' style jewelry piece, just something a bit more noticeable, I probably should've elaborated on that in my original post, but hey we all make mistakes. Which to some sounds like gold digger mentality, but I know the price range of ring she wants and it's about the same range my dad spent on my moms ring. It's something you'd see on a middleclass woman's finger, nothing huge, nothing small, just enough I guess. I still think they're just silly circles of metal and compressed dirt.     There's not much to say, we sat down talked for awhile. I explained my side of things, she explained hers. She was upset I was postponing the wedding, but once she realized I wasn't going to fold she agreed under the notion that it was 'best for our relationship to work on this before marriage.' Right now, I'm taking a step back from her to clear the air, and give us time to formulate what we want on our own. I've driven the two hours to the cabin, thankfully the internet people hooked that up yesterday. I've talked to my parents, not about them like moving in, but about the situation as a whole. (leaving out I went to the internet before I went to them.) While my dad can't just abandon his job, he sends his love and support. My mom is currently making the 18 hour drive, so 'I wouldn't be alone by myself.' I've gotten attempted phonecalls from the inlaws within the last 24 hours, but I've watched them ring and went back to doing my everyday tasks like lawnwork, meal prep, reading, bingewatching netflix.      It's strange, but right now I feel happier alone right now than I do with Fiancé. Maybe it's some sign that it's not meant to be, or that I've finally been able to relax for the first time in years and have found comfort in solitude, maybe I'm happy my mom is going to cook me my favorite dinner as a child to cheer me up. I think as of right now though, I have ALOT of work to do not only emotionally but also literally. I'm thinking about doing some telework just to still have a mainstream of income part-time, as I'll probably get bored of being jobless in about a week I need some hobbies.      TLDR: The wedding is postponed, going back to school, and probably going to be staying in the cabin until the lease is up on the 30th regardless of if I lose my security deposit, I'll just pay my Fiancé that deposit. As of right now, she definitely won't be moving into the cabin with me I truthfully want some distance between us until we can figure out how this relationship is going to continue/end.",1

I dont blame her but love is just not worth the pain and suffering. I was fine before her and this pain was something I never had to face.

So why be in a relationship when being single brings more peace and less pain.   Now, I need to find the strength in me to find the happiness and peace I had before the relationship.

Sure, just because you eliminate them inside of yourself doesn't mean that others will automatically go along with you. There's a lot of emotional work involved, including a lot of pain to grieve over as well as fear and uncertainty.  Most people are content in their misery, therefore they will not come over so easily.  Love understands this though.  We are all doing the best that we can.  Deep down we all have a tremendous desire to love, be loved, and to be happy and free.  Perhaps these are the most fundamental human needs beyond the biological needs of survival.  The good news is, when you start projecting love outward, when you start giving love without any expectation of return, when you're so full that you're overflowing... people are drawn to that.  Even if they don't know why, they find something tremendously attractive in you.  Again, this does not mean that you are going to end up with every person you like, or even that every person you meet will be attracted to you.  We all have different visions about life and not everyone can be a match.  Still, you are tremendously better off when you are projecting love than you could possibly be otherwise.  The difference is night and day.  An ugly person, physically, may not be able to become beautiful.  But when that person becomes filled with love, he or she starts to take care of themselves.  They take care of their body.  They are clean.  They walk with a new grace.  The clothes they wear are more appealing.  I have seen this happen with people.  The difference can be stunning.  And that's without even mentioning how people can be attracted to personalities, too, on a purely mental, emotional, or spiritual (non-physical) level.  You've got to be realistic, and loving yourself will not take a  1  to a  10  (as stupid as those scales are).  But it will certainly make you attractive to the point where finding a partner is only a matter of time.  I was a guy who was so closed off to love that I literally thought I had no options nor would I ever have any.  Trust me, I have not brute forced my way towards anything, nor was my desire to be a  pick-up artist  or anything foolish like that.  That said, just by loving myself, just by making an earnest effort to live life to the fullest... I have been blessed by so much love.  The gift is internal, but for purposes of this post, it is external, too.  It is amazing at how many people seem to be expressing love for me, even if some of them keep me at a distance.  It is also a gift to be able to love them, too.  It's really not about who's better or who's worse.  What a stupid thing we've invented as humans.  Love is not a competition.  Love is your birthright, it's as natural as eating, sleeping, crying, and singing.  Once you grow into it you'll see that it was never scarce, and what a tremendous gift indeed!",1

She was saying we aren’t spending enough quality time for her, quality time for her is going out, staying at hotels, going out to dinners, etc.  Each month I run out of money bc I’m trying to do all those things for her. Restaurants weekly, cooking together, site seeing, hotels, trips away, you name it we’ve done.  She cheated on her ex with me, I never blamed her as he was a extremely aggressive violent person.  However she has broken up with me, saying she feels like I “force myself” to do the things she likes. I love doing them, my idea of quality time is cuddling at home, but am always happy to compromise. She said being at home together is the “worst form of quality time she can think of”.  She wants to revisit it in two months, but she has removed me off all her social, all photos or any proof we were together and is now following her ex and liking all his photos.

If someone can PM me to have a chat, it would be much appreciated. Have had mental health issues before (attempted 4 years ago) and this has made me feel worthless. We had a joint bank account together, holiday savings account, etc.  edit: Just wanted to say how grateful I am for all the support. All of you have no idea how much this helps, I really lost some of my close mates while I was with her as she would get upset if I was around them, so I learned to put 100% of my free time into her or just training at the gym.

We were 18 and I was the best (and worst) version of myself with her. After losing her, I took the steps toward combatting my mental illness that ended up pushing her away (I have ADHD and basically shut down during the pandemic) - and worked on being the best/honest version of myself. I think I’m doing pretty good all things considered.   I was in the files of my phone looking for piano pieces I had saved, and I found a folder with EVERY important picture of the two of us and the one that was burned into my brain after I erased it - that looked exactly like I remembered it. It was made for a scrapbook I made for her for one of our anniversaries.  Fuck. Everything came rushing back. It’s upsetting that everything I’ve felt about her has carried on with me. I don’t think the way I feel about her will ever change.   Even now, with someone who I cherish and adore and wake up next to everyday - I think it’s awful to feel this way.

I think he's into me too. What to do? He is also my best friend.     6 months ago I finished university abroad and returned to my home country. I was abroad for almost 5 years, before leaving I became friends with let's call him H. We have known each other for a long time but we became very close after my return. For the last 6 months before my return, we were in daily contact, and he kept telling me that he couldn't wait for me to return, he even picked me up at the airport on my return. Since my return, we started hanging out often, on a daily basis. I didn't notice that we had boundaries in our relationship or that he had a girlfriend. From time to time I saw that some Mary was sending him messages, but when he was with me, he didn't reply, he didn't call her either. He was cooming to my workplace, hugging me, called me in the middle of the day and night, sent me good morning and good night messages. On a weekly basis, we are together 4/5 times for a longer period of time (several hours each time).      I have to admit that I fell in love with him, but I said we were best friends when he asked me what we were, because I didn't want to lose him. He told me that he adored me, that I was his sunshine, joy and wind at his back. He brought me home, took me to dinners, we drove in the car and sang. In general, we had a relationship without boundaries.      Until a week ago when Mary attacked me on the street. She was screaming at me to back off, to not touch her boyfriend and that they've been together for 7 fucking months. I didnt eaven know who she is. He saw me, called her to attack her and yelled at her for what she told me and did. I didn't answer him that day and he called me 150 times, sent 50 messages. He called me in the middle of the night and begged me to answer, to talk to him and that he just wanted me to talk to him. To be angry, curse but just to talk. I answered, we talked for an hour.      The next day he called me, we had a fight. I asked him why he didn't tell me that he has a girlfriend, because we are often together, and he said: she is not important to me, I don't love her, I didn't know how and when he would say it. That's where we argued again, because if you don't love her, why are you with her?      He was upset and I asked him if he is afraid of losing me because of the project we are working together soon or because he loves me? He says that he loves me and that everything should be clear to me from that. We should have talked about it, but we didn't have the chance. He says that it scared him a lot and that he was confused as to how much it scared him that I didn't call him and never call him again. We kissed on one occasion.      When he's with me, the girl doesn't exist, he doesn't respond to her, he doesn't mention her and he doesn't call her. His friends eaven l ask him if I know that he has a girlfriend and he lied that I knew.      I must mention that I became this good with him after he found a girlfriend.      He says that he is calling me, that he loves me, that he has pulled himself together. But I still don't know what to do.. I don't want to be the one to ruin the relationship but I think that every decision I make will lead to that.",1
Gback27,Letting Go of The Person You Love Might Be The Most Heartbreaking Thing in The Word,298,12cvl34,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/12cvl34/letting_go_of_the_person_you_love_might_be_the/,42,2023-04-05 19:44:21,love,"   I'm a 30 y/o male and just wanted to put this out there.  Years ago after I graduated college I moved across country to Sacramento, CA. I've never really been someone that has been great at expressing my emotions or talking about how I feel. I feel like I am a decent looking man but when I was 23/24 I started going bald pretty quickly. It was a really difficult time for me and my confidence. However, right in the midst of all this I met this incredible girl named Danielle, who had just moved in with a co-worker of mine.  Danielle & I hit it off right away. We spent a lot of time together but didn't date as she got out of a long relationship. Though we didn't date we continued spending more and more time together and were essentially dating. Weeks turned to months until Cinco De Mayo. Our friend group was out celebrating at this restaurant called Ernesto's and eventually the focus turned to roasting Danielle & I. They poked and laughed trying get us to just come out and admit we were dating already. Danielle finally threw her arms up and cheerfully said fine you're right were dating and gave me a kiss. Though it was our first, it was her first as my girlfriend :).  Have you ever asked yourself what the happiest moment of your life has been? Luckily for me I have a picture of it. Danielle & I went away to San Luis Obispo for a long weekend. One of the days we spend the evening on Avila Beach as the sun was going down. We smoked a joint laying on the beach and set up a camera to take some pictures of us in the sunset. There is one in particular of me holding her up above my head (think dirty dancing) with the clouds, the mountains and setting sun creating this amazing blend of orangey color with the two of us taking it all in, falling and laughing in the sand. Though that was almost 6 years ago now I can still feel it like it was yesterday.  After a few years in Cali I started to miss the east coast and explored new careers. I got offered a job in Maryland and accepted. Luckily for me I am Irish and Danielle was happy to come with. In hindsight this was probably the start of where things went downhill. We spent the first year living a good bit outside of Baltimore. It was a tough year for her as there were not as many young people to make friends with and really leaned on me. We got through it though and moved to a neighborhood in Baltimore called Fed Hill where we both made friends.  Again things changed with COVID in 2020. Everything shut down- bars, restaurants, cancelled concerts, many of the things we enjoyed. Looking back & being honest I think it is safe to say I probably became depressed. Admittedly, I took this out on her. All this adorable girl from California wanted to was spend quality time with me and doing anything with her became a chore. I was what she had out here, not family, few friends and the limitations of COVID. It is difficult being the sole reason for someone's happiness. It continued to weigh on me and I kept pushing away further. Instead of talking about how I felt, I would just suppress them and go through the motions.  She gave me somewhat of an ultimatum that she wanted to get married in the short term. It was hard for me to promise this. There was so much we still had to work through. What if she wanted to move to Cali or Denver? She lived there and loved it there too. She wasn't so career oriented and I had a great job that I was finally getting some momentum with. I thought it would be crazy to just up and move because she might like the idea of Denver in a few years. I wasn't able to make her that promise and ontop of that my communication of it was terrible. She had a lot to think about.  She went back home for a week to think about the future. She came back in June and let me know she thought it would be best for her to go back west. That summer was one of the biggest regrets of my life. I didn't fight for our relationship, I didn't try to work through our challenges, we spent this time in a period of awkwardness.  I still remember her last day here. We got sushi to go and ate it on this bench in Fed Hill Park that over looks the harbor. Drank wine and cuddled on the couch watching a netflix movie. It felt like old times no issues yet she would be leaving a few hours later. We made love one last time and fell asleep having to get up early for the airport.  I remember sitting in the bathroom with her as she packed up the last of her things. I'm not sure either of us said a word, I don't think I could. I felt the tears in my eyes. I drove her to the airport at 5am,  The Scientist  by Coldplay playing in the background. I had wrote her a letter at work in the weeks prior that I slipped into her carry on bag while she wasn't looking. As got the things out of my car she opened her carry on to get something and saw I had tucked it in there. I can still see her face, her eyes welling with tears but this smile on her face that at that moment she knew that I still loved her. I watched her walking through the airport both of us making the I LOVE YOU sign with our hands. I went home and cried. That would be the last I saw her.  Or so I thought. This past summer she was in Baltimore for a friends wedding and I saw she was in town on IG. I was out with friends and she with hers but they came to the bar we were at. Everyone left us to chat and we sat there and caught up on things. 2+ years had gone by and here she was in front of me in the same city where we used to live. A few things stick out from this convo. I remember she asked me why I didn't fight for her to stay. I loved this girl, I didn't want to hold her back in Baltimore. Through tears I asked her if she was happy, how her and her new BF are. She was happy and I was right. It would have been selfish to fight for her to stay.  The weekend went by and my emotions were a wreck. We met once more for breakfast. We didn't have much else to say. It was clear she had moved on and was happy. She kept asking if there was anything else I wanted to say but all I could muster out through tears was that it was great to see her every time. It wouldn't be right or fair for me to tell her I miss her, I still love her and wish things were different.  That Sunday I went out for drinks with friends at this bar called One Star. it was much needed, I was needed to take my mind of the emotional weekend. But sure as shit, Danielle was there. We didnt plan this so, she wanted to be with her friends so after we said hello I let her do her thing. I don't remember much of our final convo, not sure if it was the alcohol the emotions or a mix of both. There were a lot of  I love you's  coming from both of us. After she left I just sat at this table with my head in my hands crying. I have some damn good friends. Each of them telling me that they loved me and comforted me while I was clearly heartbroken.  That was the last time I saw or spoke to her. She's engaged now happily living in San Diego. I'm truly happy for her and that she has found someone to spend her life with. She's an amazing person. I don't think about her all the time but every now and then I hear a song that reminds me of her. I occasionally go sit on that bench in Fed Hill Park and drink my coffee.  I think I will always be at least a part of me that will love Danielle. Hopefully one day I will find someone that will make me feel the you did that day on Avila beach.  Choosing to let go of the person you love so that they can live a life you can never give them is the most heartbreaking thing in the world.",1

We've been married almost 2 years and together for 3. About 6 months ago she was diagnosed with ASD which explained a lot. One thing that bothers me though is that she won't express love for me verbally or through writing. She describes it as uncomfortable or almost painful, which is hurtful. She says that saying  I love you  feels like touching something gross, which doesn't make sense to me. She won't naturally say it to anyone except her Mom. She won't say it to her family. She will respond when I say  I love you  with a quick  Love you too  but never says it of her own accord. I've talked about how I need verbal affection, and she says she's trying and will tell me she loves me without prompting once a week. She does tell me once a week now, but it doesn't feel like enough and it doesn't make me feel good because I know she's forcing herself to do it. She says she shows love in other ways like showing me a flower she found or baking me a cake I like. But I'm still not happy and don't feel loved. How do we fix this? Are my requests unreasonable or is there a better way to handle this?  Edit: I should have made it clear I don't want to end my marriage and I love my wife. I just want to feel loved myself.  TLDR: My autistic wife doesn't tell me that she loves me and I feel unloved and unhappy about it.",1

I had gotten this message from this random girl on Instagram. She sent me a picture of my bf and a picture of his “area”… I was so confused and confronted him. He was notably shocked and started freaking out. At first he wasn’t really saying much. This person was a scammer and was asking me for money or they’d send our university the pictures. It’s was stupid but they sent me the screenshots of my bf and them messaging. They really didn’t engage all that much. She dm’d him, he didn’t respond till days later. She asked him if he wanted to have fun and he said “wanna play chess” (he plays chess, this was an innocent offer) she says no and sends a picture, and then asks him for one. He sends it. But thats really it. They weren’t talking for a long time and all he did was send the picture. He fessed up, told me all that happened, not a single detail left out, there wasn’t much to fill me in on but he told me the truth. He was scared about getting scammed and knew it was right to tell me instead of lying. He did everything right after this huge wrong… He never blamed me for this. He made sure my feelings were validated and admitted that what he did was wrong and unfaithful. He asked for help and received it. He was genuinely ashamed and embarrassed but he was trying his best to recover from what happened as well. He’s always been the innocent one. We went to a few of our friends and I consulted some of my really close family… every single person told me to give him another chance. He’s a guy who has never done anything wrong. The crazy thing is that my super close friends and family are always like “oh leave a man who don’t treat you right” and don’t stand by this stuff. But with him, they all genuinely believe it’s an honest mistake. That it’s something I will never get answers to but that he is truly sorry.   Things have been okay since then. We don’t pretend as if it never happened, we talk about it openly and work on how we feel. But I feel like I lost him. I love him a lot and know everyone says “if he loved you then he wouldn’t do that” but like this guy genuinely does love me. It’s sounds like I’m just coming up with a ton of excuses but I’m seriously not. Every single person believes that I should stay with him. I mean, I am staying with him but it feels wrong.   He doesn’t know why he did it. He’s talked to people and worked through his feelings but still has no answer for why. Granted, when this happened, it was an incredibly hard time for the both of us in our own personal lives. But since then, we’ve really learned to be more open with each other. I just feel stupid for staying with him because all my life I was told “don’t stay with a cheater” but here I am… staying with one and everyone thinks I should too. Am I missing something? I just don’t know what to do…",1
kzzzz3,"Possibly in love with my housemate/close friend, but not sure how to approach this with her",0,135fmc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/135fmc7/possibly_in_love_with_my_housemateclose_friend/,7,2023-05-02 09:01:03,relationships,"TLDR: I’ve been living with a housemate/friend for around 4 years and I’ve had feelings for her most of this time. I get jealous at the thought of her being with someone else, but I don’t want to make our friendship awkward by mentioning this, but would also regret never finding out how she feels.  —  I (30M, London, UK) moved in to a house share about 4 years ago, then moved into a smaller flat with 2 girls from the house share who I became good friends with. Then a year ago, I moved into another flat with just 1 of those girls, and now it’s just the 2 of us living together.  I’ve had feelings for my housemate/friend (26F) for a few years whilst I’ve been living with her, but this has never come up between us, despite being a talking point between me and my friends.  Neither of us are particularly good at dating and basically can’t be bothered, but she does talk all the time about a colleague who she fancies (who probably wouldn’t be good for her anyway.)  It basically feels like we are living together as a couple, but without any intimacy. Though I would say that she is sometimes teasing, pays compliments, and is generally closer than I would expect, despite the fact that nothing has ever happened beyond very low-key teasing (things that I would say allude to the idea that she at least isn’t afraid of me etc.)  It’s all of this closeness that keeps pulling me back into thinking “what if” and also feeling like it’s possible, and that I would actually like us to become more than friends.  I’m just not sure if she has any feelings for me, and I don’t want to spoil our friendship, or make our living situation awkward by asking her how she feels, or stating my feelings towards her.  Whenever I discuss this with friends they can’t decide whether telling her is a good idea or not, and it bounces between “if you don’t tell her you’ll always regret it” and “but you could make your living situation very awkward and ruin your friendship”.  Part of me thinks that something would have happened by now if it was meant to be - since we’ve been hanging out all the time for the last few years. I’m also not sure if she would mention her attraction towards her colleague if she had any consideration that something could happen between us in the future.  There was also a situation recently where she is going to a wedding and her friend mentioned at a bar (to me also) that I could come with her to the wedding. She responded by saying “but we’d have to share a bed”, as if that was a bad thing.  I’m at a point now where I feel like I should at least approach this with her somehow, but I want to find a way of casually finding out how she feels without going straight in and asking her if she wants to be more than friends.  She has mentioned a couple of times now that she has had dreams about me being with other people. The first time she said she dreamed that I had been sleeping with someone, but hadn’t told her, and that this made her upset. She reiterated that she felt sad purely because I had kept this secret from her. The second time she told me she had dreamed about me and my colleague having intimate relations, and that she wasn’t going to tell me originally because “it would be weird”.  I’m at a point where whenever she goes on a night out, I basically can’t sleep because I’m thinking about what she might be doing, and it does make me anxious and upset. I just wonder if she has a similar thing going on, or if this is a dead end with her. I definitely don’t want to ruin our friendship.  I’m considering bringing this up with her in a subtle way, such as saying “You said a couple of times that you’ve had dreams about me being with other people. Does this mean anything or am I thinking too much into it?”, and see how she reacts. I think if she asks more questions, then I can elaborate on the way I feel.  I feel like we would be a good couple, and I’m sure she would understand why I feel this way, but I just don’t want to make her feel awkward, when we’re going to be living together for at least another year (or basically until one of us gets into another relationship and moves in with that person)  Any advice/thoughts appreciated, so that I can finally stop going around in circles with her! I feel like either something needs to be said, or I need to stop spending all my spare time with her (going for walks, watching TV etc. - she even invited me to her parents house this summer which would involve flying there!)  I feel like approaching this with her is a good idea now, even if she rejects it. At least then she knows what she’s dealing with when she goes on to have relations with other guys etc, and she knows how I feel and can work around that.",1

I’ve not been able to properly type this post out because it’s been an incredibly difficult time for me and I just end up breaking down.   I (18F) was raped two years ago by an ex boyfriend after telling him multiple times I was not ready to lose my virginity.  He pinned me down and did what he wanted anyway, and since then I’ve not talked about it much because it has traumatized me deeply.   I’ve been in therapy ever since just trying to heal and find ways to be okay with the turn my life has taken since that event.  My new (ex) boyfriend (20M) knew I was in therapy, he didn’t know why because I’m still uncomfortable talking about it to people face to face, and I was afraid it would change the way he perceived me.  I still consider myself a virgin because virginity to me is given, not taken against one’s will.  I met this man about a year ago and we started off as friends.  We began dating six months ago and everything was going great.  Around the three month mark, he asked me if I was a virgin to which I responded yes, because again, I did not “give” my body to that man.  He took it for himself.  Fast forward to last week.  I accidentally left my copy of mine and my therapist’s session notes which contained information about my rape.  Boyfriend came over, read them while I was in the bathroom and confronted me right away.  It wasn’t supportive to say the least.  It was incredibly hurtful coming from a man I thought loved and cared about me.  He called me a liar, (referring to the part where I still consider myself a virgin) he called me untrustworthy, he said a lot of hurtful things while I tried to explain as calmly as I could.  He just didn’t get it.    I tried explaining that I talk about it as little as possible with non-professionals because I don’t want to be constantly thinking about it, and because it’s incredibly triggering for me and in my personal life I’d like to almost live as if it never happened.  He didn’t care.  he told me that I was purposely deceptive, and that he was repulsed by liars.  He even said “By definition you’re not even a virgin so you lied about that too.  I don’t even know who you are so I’m done with you.  Go fuck yourself.”   I haven’t known what to do.  I didn’t mean to “lie”.  I just don’t want this to define my life.  I don’t want to have to disclose this information with every new potential partner, it’s humiliating and traumatic to relive it even when I’m talking it over with my therapist.  I think he was super unfair and void of any kind of empathy in the way that he addressed the situation and at this point I don’t even think I want to love another man again, because the only examples I’ve been shown are heartless, selfish, entitled, violent, abusive... I’m tired of trusting them because every man I’ve had high hopes for ended up totally letting me down.  I don’t want to sound like or become a misandrist, I just don’t understand the way a good amount of them think or how they could think/behave the way they do.  Like if he claims to have loved me, why was his initial reaction to be angry at me and not him? Why did he not want to be supportive towards the woman he claimed to have loved?",1

But my daughter decided to tell my husband.  For those asking, my husband is a present father but he is always away from town, which is why we are more comfortable than the average family in town. Anyways, my husband came back early and he was not happy. I was out when he came back but he threw my son out, he said that he expected real change from him before he is allowed back.   When I got back my son already packed his essential and left, my husband have to leave tomorrow, but my son is already texting me saying that it was heartless of us and so on.  I'm not sure what to do now but my husband told me to just take care of the house and he will handle this away from town. My daughter was very supportive of my husband and has been screaming at my son whenever he comes knocking.  As much as I love how much my family has tried to support me. But I feel like my family's torn apart. I never wanted to have my son kicked out and never wanted such discord in my family.   If there's a positive outcome, I will update again and soon hopefully but for now. I've prepared a small amount of cash for my son till he can find a way to stand on his own.   And I would like to thank all of you lovely people who left such nice comments. But I'm not sure if I could have fully conveyed the nuances of my situation 100% fairly.",1

Meanwhile, the other partner may feel confused and say things like  How can I know what you want me to do if you haven't asked? I'm not a mind reader.  This leads to a cycle of frustration, with the first partner feeling like they always have to take initiative, and the other partner feeling like they are doing things but not getting enough credit for them..  Well, I'm in a wonderful relationship with a guy who is literal gold. And he actually recently shared a trick he uses to avoid that issue all together: Once or twice a day, when he sees me doing something, or I'm about to do something, he tells me not to worry about it and immediately does it for me. It doesn't have to be anything big, it can literally be grabbing something I need from the other room, hanging my jacket, opening the door for me or plating the salad while I'm cooking. Every once in a while he will take over a bigger chore from me like swiping the floor, and he'll tell me that I've done a lot today or I seem tired, or I deserve the rest and I should go sit down. He said it really can be anything, even if it doesn't actually take real chores off anyone's plate.  And right enough, Every single time he's done that I felt like I was the luckiest girl in the world. If I was feeling at all stressed due to other reasons, that small daily gesture always puts me in a great mood. If ever I felt frustrated with him, it vanishes. It's so simple but it ticks so many boxes: It makes me feel like he's not only thinking about me, but appreciates me. It also makes me feel secure and safe.  I really encourage anyone to give it a go at this, it's so simple and doesn't cost any money.",1
ThrowRA060111,My wife (31F) of 10 years says she wants me (38M) to give her space because she feels neglected and doesn't know if she's in love with me anymore.,2,13dakgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13dakgc/my_wife_31f_of_10_years_says_she_wants_me_38m_to/,7,2023-05-10 00:02:43,relationships,"Sorry for the long-winded story.  Last week my wife was acting weird and I asked her if there was something on her mind and she said yes, that she wanted to talk to me. We sat down and she told me that she felt like I was no longer affectionate with her; that I was not intimate with her (our sex life had died down but it wasn't intentional, of course), and that I wasn't spending enough time with her and our boy (16 months old). She also said I wasn't carrying my weight around the house with chores and she felt overwhelmed.  I've had to deal with a lot of stressful events in my life during our relationship, including taking care of my mother with dementia in the last few years where I had to change her diaper and wipe her down, and going through that on a daily basis just made me broken. I felt like I had to shut my brain down to forget about it all and perhaps that led to me not focusing on our relationship and intimacy. Our sex life died down after 4 years of being very active but it wasn't like I didn't find her attractive or desire her; I absolutely did. I just couldn't get sexually aroused. At the time we had this issue (about 3-4 years ago), she did suggest we use toys and watch porn but I felt emasculated by it and didn't feel like I needed toys to please my woman, so I refused. I was stupid for doing so and I admit that. But I feel like I've been very affectionate with her. I would kiss her and hug her and flirt and touch her randomly throughout our relationship and primarily hang out with her. I barely even saw my friends anymore as we did almost everything together. And this year, I've had a slew of health scares and have been going to doctor after doctor getting tests done, and luckily nothing serious was diagnosed, but I was still super stressed and anxious awaiting results and feeling various symptoms. We moved out in Nov-2022 and got our own place. And while I admit that I became lazy and didn't clean the house as much as she wanted me to, I still did a lot of caring for the baby and cooking and doing laundry. I feel like the problems with intimacy were not just contributed by me. Throughout the majority of our relationship, she's made me feel guilty about petty stuff. For example, I would always play with her hair and scratch her back, nearly every single night. But there were nights when I was tired and just wasn't in the mood. She'd ask for me to scratch her back and when I would say no, she'd go all quiet and give me the silent treatment. This drove me nuts because I'm someone who loves to communicate and talk about issues right then and there. I asked her many times not to do that as it made me feel guilty for saying no to her. It got to a point where I was paranoid anytime she asked me for something because if I said no, it would lead to silent treatment or an argument since she wouldn't communicate with me after going silent.  This isn't the first time she's asked for space. She did so about 4 years into our relationship when she kept wanting us to go to different places and do all sorts of things, and since I was paying for it all, it became a financial burden to me. I told her it was hard for me to keep up and to also save for a ring and a future for us. It eventually got to a point where she acted weird again, and after berating her with questions about what was bugging her, she finally broke down and told me that she felt like I was depriving her of her happiness and kept telling her no, so she asked for space and moved in with her sister. After a few months, she hit me up and asked to get back together, which we did.  Overall she's been an amazing person to me and I've learned to look past her flaws and accept her for who she is. I love her and care about her so much and don't want to lose her, but it feels like the damage has been done. After she told me she wanted this second time, I tried to sit her down and talk to her calmly about how I felt it was unfair that she was throwing all of these problems onto me and that perhaps we both contributed to the demise of parts of our relationship. I told her that we have a child now and that we need to try our best to make things work, if not for us then for him. But she's in this mood where she's refusing to want to work with me. She says she doesn't know how she feels or if she wants to make this work. I asked her if we can go see a therapist and she said no, but that I could go on my own and take this time to work on bettering myself. She also claims that she suggested we go see a therapist before we got married, which she had done but at the time I didn't think anything was wrong with us so I refused. She also said that these things have been happening for a while and that I got complacent and too comfortable in the relationship and she's scared to try again and have me fall back into the same ways as before. I asked her if she was feeling this way for a while, then why did she marry me and have a child with me? She didn't have a response for me. She just sat there quietly. And the more I try to talk to her about it, the more frustrated she gets and tells me that I just don't get it. So now I've decided to honor her request for space once again, but this time we're living together because we signed a 16-month lease on an apartment and can't afford to break it.  I'm a sensitive and emotional person and this really has been breaking my heart and making me freak out about the fact that I'm about to lose the love of my life. I was terrified of settling down and having kids and only did so because I trusted her. She would reassure me so much that we'd be there for each other forever and that she would help teach us how to be parents (she helped raise her nieces so she had practice with kids). I've taken this whole week constantly reflecting on my own flaws and wondering where I went wrong and how could I have been so blind to not see the signs that she supposedly gave me. She's mentioned the no-sex thing a few times but it was during a very stressful point in my life where I was focused on my mom and I didn't mean to ignore her. I just didn't process it properly. I don't know what to do. I'm just giving her space but it feels so weird. We sleep in the same bed. I work from home so I'm always home and around her on her off days. And she seems unbothered by it all. I haven't seen her anxious or cry about it at all, while I've been an emotional wreck. I don't know what to do. It's so hard to find the motivation to get out and do my own thing or start a hobby like most people suggest to do during these trying times. I just wallow and think about all of the mistakes I made but at the same time feel like we both did things to each other to cause these problems and not sure if she gets that. We've been together for 10 years and have done everything together. I've grown to be so close with her and rely on her for things and now I feel very alone and in a dark place.      **tl;dr: Wife asked me to give her space for the second time in our relationship because she feels neglected and is refusing to work on reconciling the marriage.**",1

I just am currently trying to process my thoughts and how i should feel about the current situation. I'm not sure if i'm looking for advise or just to put it out there to help me process things.  My girlfriend who i have been seeing for 5 months asked me yesterday if i said i love you to my previous partners.  In my 2 previous relationships, one was for 5 years and i left her after she got her visa. i realised through the visa process that she was not someone i wanted to be with but stayed in the relationship as she would have had to leave the country if we actually broke up and stopped the visa application which requires updated proof of relationship for authenticity reasons.  The other i was with for a year but after a year of seeing her i was getting to the stage where i was asking myself if this was someone i want to settle down with seriously and i decided that she was not someone i wanted to settle down with so i left the relationship - this was something we discussed and we both mutually felt like the relationship wasn't going anywhere. it was hard because we both liked each other and got along well.  when i said to my girlfriend i said loved them the mood changed and i could tell it wasn't sitting right. She said it made her sad and basically that when i say i love you it doesnt carry as much weight, she said she had only said it to two other people. her exhusband and her teenage love who she was very in love with. I called this morning and we discussed it a bit further as she was feeling a bit better after a sleep but basically she wants us to take a break from saying it for a bit. we have been saying it to each other for a month or two now and i genuinely feel like i do love her and it hurts to hear what she said but im also trying respect her feelings. She is still commited to me and i am her and if she feels like this is what she needs then so be it but i am just a bit kind of sad about the situation. not sure why i'm posting this. maybe to see other peoples unbiased thoughts on the situation? Maybe to get some insight from others that would feel this way what would make them feel more secure?   &#x200B;  tl;dr - girlfriend thinks when i say i love you to her it does not carry as much weight and wants to take a break from saying it for a bit as i have said it to my ex partners which i left.",1

I love her a lot and have no desire to lose her.   However, I am a little surprised by what she has confided in me last night.   Every night, we have a rule that we'll save any serious non-urgent topics that were brought up during the day for after dinner, due to being able to think clearer with no distractions. If we have nothing much to say, we like telling each other of stories we remember from our early days, from childhood all the way to our relationship.  Last night, my girlfriend told me a few disturbing stories from her life: The first was when she was little (around 9), she lived in a big house, and when no one was around, she'd carry cats up to the second floor and drop them out the window to see if they'd land on their feet.  She also had a dog and told me that she would sprinkle rat poison into its water bowl to see what would happen to it (it died).  She liked fire, so when she was 10, she lit up a clump of dry matter which started a mini forest fire (the fire happened at the top of a hill, and luckily it only burnt the top part).  When she was 12, she was given a slighnshot as a gift, and she along with her cousin hid in some bushed and purposefully shot an old man walking along the road because they were curious what would happen. She didn't remember what happened to him.  Through her teens, she had a bad relationship with her parents and took that out on others or herself. She admitted she had many suicidal thoughts and that she has imagined killing her parents many times.  She has a crooked finger from when she punched a wall hard and broke her finger. She never told anyone about it, and it healed over time. She has also had bouts of cutting her wrists and ripping off her toe nails. She also had very short finger nails when I met her, due to her being nervous when living with her parents and biting her fingernails through their pink roots, to halfway down the pink nail part.  She told me that she manipulated people to feel sorry for her or to give her attention. She was also a compulsive liar (she says she started this to hide things from her parents), and that whenever someone asked her questions, she'd usually lie about small things, or that when they asked about her life, she'd add details to make it sound worse than it was.   At the start of our relationship, she stalked all my accounts online (we met online through friends) to find out what I liked and didn't like and manipulated me into liking her. She said that she made sure to always make me smile and happy whenever she could, and would always suggest something I'd like to do to spend time with me online, and she'd always wear suggestive clothes around me, when we met up together with friends. She'd always stick close to me when we were out in public together.  I thought that we just clicked, and I didn't realise that I was her (target?), but I don't know if that's a bad thing or not.  I am a bit concerned about her, but I don't see this as a reason to cause us to break up. She said it in such a way, like it was a childhood story, and I guess it was 2 years ago.   We don't really have many fights or disagreements. We talk about everything that happens when we're apart, and we jell well when we're together.  I'm just posting here to make sure that this is (normal?). I mean, I know that she's a bit psychopathic, but since we've been together, I haven't really noticed her being crazy or controlling. What do you think?      Edit: More context for others. Her father used to physically discipline her (punch/belt/slap) her from when she was young, until I got her to move out at 19. Her mother also physically disciplined her (pinched).   Her 2 siblings are still living with her parents. We maintain limited contact to check on the condition of the siblings. Our conversations are very brief over the phone, and visits are also short.  They were not a good environment for her to grow up in, so she has been living with me for 2 years. Her mental health has improved, and her overall appearance has vastly improved.  She has not been to any therapy or psych evaluations. She says that she does not need these and that she's stable.  We do not have any pets or kids planned. I do think she's improved a lot mentally since we have been together.  It was a shock that she had manipulated people, but I felt that she did what she thought was right.     Edit 2: After reading everyone's comments, I'll be going the therapy route. Therapy for her and couples therapy look to be the best ideas. I hope the therapists help her re-evaluate the things she has done.  There were a few comments wondering if I had noticed any sociopathic tendencies during our relationship, and I really haven't. She told me about her struggles with life from her childhood trauma, but the progress she has made from when I first met her until now is very evident.  She was very scared and depressed living in the situation she was in, and now she's happy and outgoing. She's confident and the best person she's ever been.  I appreciate everyone's suggestions on me saving myself and leaving her, but I have no plans on leaving someone I love and care about this much.   I'll take the suggestions of therapy on board and try to slowly push her into that direction. Thank You everyone for your help.    Edit 3: Further information on all this. Her family dog was mistreated a lot by her father (we'll call him J). J had a garden in the backyard that the dog would continue getting into and digging holes in. J would pick the dog up and throw him across the lawn.   The official cause of death for the dog was bowel problems. She thinks it is due to the poison.  Context on the cats: Her family had 8 cats in the house. One time a cat took a poo on the family bed, J found out and hit the cat until it started excreting diarrhoea over the bed. He then took it into the car and drove 20 minutes away and through it out the car. I'm not saying what she did was alright, but in the context of her observing what J did, I can see why she did it.   The land was J's land. He liked starting fires to burn off excess dry matter. However, he started controlled fires. She liked looking at the fires, so she wanted to start her own fire. However, that connected to a forest and lit up the forest at the top of the hill. Luckily, it didn't end in a forest fire.   She manipulated people because she didn't want her parents to discipline her if she said the wrong thing, or if something similar happened.    I do think she had a crush on me, but she also wanted me to help her out of her situation. I don't know if she is or is not a sociopath, but I do know that she's much better now.   I think that a lot of what she has done was because of her upbringing, and since getting away from her parents, she's been much better.  Thank you, everyone, again for your suggestions. I will be staying with her, and making sure she gets the professional attention needed.    Edit 4: Context on our living arrangements. We are renting a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom house for $400 per week.   We both have part-time jobs. I am an agricultural advisor. She's a barrista.   My father purchased 5 acres for me when I was a child, and my girlfriend and I are planning on building a house on it to live together.   We were both raised in Christian households, so we are both virgins.   We have no short-term plans for marriage, but we will do so in the future, however that hinges on whether these issues are just past issues or past and present, and I shall be finding (or I shall push her into finding) professional help for her issues.   Thank You again. This has showed me that I do need to find her professional help, and that it's definitely more serious than I thought.  I do not want to break up with her, but I shall see after she sees a medical professional.",1

We've been through highs and lows, started off with a relationship, ended it due to bad timing but we didn't give up on eachother for a minute.  We held onto eachothers presence in eachothers life, even when it was hard. And it was hard. The breakup broke me. He wasn't well either. We held onto the care and the love.   I learned to love him entirely, completely, for everything he is and everything he stands for. Beyond being in love. Beyond attraction.  The amount of care, love, affection, attention is something I didn't imagine possible. The reliability and maturity, the loyalty, the availability. He makes me feel safe and comfortable, always. At peace. Protected and taken care of. Allows me to be in my feminine energy, for the first time, ever. We reunited later on, both admitting the love and want and need is too much to not be together.  We worked through individual needs and wants so we can be content with what we have.  Which brings us to today. The past 2 weeks have been possibly the most difficult I've been through in my life. I'm on the verge of losing my business, the work I've put in for years. It has been a grief process, with very dark moments in between.  It took me a few days to muster the courage to tell him. Everything. Open up, be weak and vulnerable. Not because I didn't trust him, but because I didn't want to burden him.  He dragged me out of bed, forced me to take a much needed shower and fed me. Soaked up way too many tears, calmed down way too many shaking hands and breathing. Said so many prayers. Moved in with me for the past week, to be there on better or worst days. Listened and adviced me. Held me through the night.  And he did all this so naturally, so flawlessly. As if this is what anyone would do. I never asked. Never expected. I wanted to shield him from all the negativity and he just embraced it, really tight, and didn't let go.  There has been so much in the past year with us.   And everytime I think my love for him is absolute and infinite, he proves to me that I can love him more.",1

He also has an expensive car loan which is around $800 a month.      A few months ago he expressed concerns to me that his workplace was heading in a bad direction and he was unhappy with the new management they had introduced. I encouraged him to start looking for a new job while working at his current one, but also warned him that there is a recession looming, and leaving solid employment is a very risky move. He agreed with me that he would start to look for a new job, however he never did. Of course, 6 weeks later the job had become unbearable for him mentally so he handed in his resignation with no new job lined up.      We are now almost 7 weeks into him being unemployed and unable to even land an interview, the car loan has completely eaten his savings and he is no longer contributing to groceries and bills. I have had to lend him money to keep him from defaulting on his car loan, and money to pay for his pet's medical bills. I am financially struggling to lend him this money as I've been hit hard by mortgage rate rises and cost of living. I expect to have to loan him more money again soon.      I want to make clear that all other aspects of our life are great. He treats me with all the love and care in the world and is the absolute best part of my day. However the seeds of doubt have been planted in my head. I have had many weeks to think about what happened and come to the conclusion that I feel hurt by his decision. I feel he did not take me into consideration at all, and did not think of the consequences on both of us if he was to just walk away from his job.      I am at a crossroads in my life, my options are to ride the lightning and hope he finds a job soon, but potentially have this mistrust and doubt hanging over me forever. The 2nd option is to end the relationship and move back in with my family, so I can put my house up for rent and try to rebalance my financials to weather the oncoming recession.      Is a situation like this cause enough for a breakup of an otherwise healthy relationship?      TLDR: Boyfriend of 2 years suddenly quit his job with no backup plan.

Is this okay?",0,13x4gw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/13x4gw2/my_gf19f_wants_to_breakup_after_2_years_with/,31,2023-06-01 01:26:48,relationship_advice,"I'm 23 (M) and she is 19 (F)      So basically would you consider emotional neglect (not showing enough love) if your partner has really bad IBS-D and he can't go out much, maybe once a week or twice, but is usually at home due to flare ups (if they did therapy, colonoscopies, took different meds to no avail) is this something worth breaking up a 2 year long relationship over?      I am asking because I am suffering from that IBS and I couldn't take my girl out much and we would mostly walk in parks or go sometimes to a bar because of my nasty condition (NOT USING THIS AS EXCUSE) but I seriously had almost had xyz amount of times where I could've had an accident or two outside and I need to be close to toilet at all times and usually I spend 20 mins in there.      My gf said we didn't do much as couple because of that and that she feels like I didn't show her love and affection even though I was always supportive of her, her decisions, bought her stuff, paid for her trips and never cheated, lied, raised my voice or hit her.      I don't want to be petty but this really did hurt me in a way, because I thought she understood me a bit better and because she knew what hell I went through trying to find medication to fix my stomach.      She said I didn't show her love and had other priorities (like working from home long hours) but she didn't really call me out much nor was she asking me all that often to go out, so I'm confused here because on one hand maybe I should've forced myself to somehow put it through and go out with her more even though I had to go to bathroom sometimes 4 times in an hour and it would be urgent.      But then again, she didn't complain before, sometimes she'd suggest us to stuff which sometimes we would do and sometimes we couldn't because of my health issues. I am confused and really kind of sad that I can't provide and show her love in that way, but I am trying my best to show her love in every other way, she said she wants memories and to go out more now and said she didn't feel loved in the past year or so... I didn't even notice that tbh.      I feel like this is an ultimatum now before she's off for good, because I couldn't meet her needs and because I was emotionally abusive? Or was I? I am confused because she knows how bad my condition is and how I can't even train like I did a couple of years ago nor go out for walks as it really effed me up and my social life because of how bad it is on a daily basis, now it's a little bit better because I finally found some meds that can somewhat help but other than that I still have strong symptoms mostly... Lately she's been slow fading on me and acting distant and there's a guy that I don't know that goes to the gym with her that is snooping on my social media... She even wanted me to give her phone so she can see what I was talking to my good girl friend about, because I have one girl friend that I knew for so long and she never asked me for my phone, I gave it to her but I have a feeling that she could be losing interest in me or maybe she is saying this as a way of finding reason to pull the plug. I am kind of confused and hurt and sad I couldn't provide her with things that she wanted like better dates or longer dates or more dates or trips... I hate myself.      TL:DR my gf said I didn't show her love and affection for the past year because we didn't go out much and such but she knows I have  crippling  IBSD and I can't literally go out much most of the time (we went out maybe once a week or 2 times) because other times I would be literally going to the toilet 10'+ times a day and having to spend 20 mins in it at a time is no fun... Am I neglecting her or what's going on? I want to go out more, I really do, but it's really hard for me and I made it clear to her, but I usually initiate going out after all, because she doesn't do that as much yet she complains about it now after 2 years...",1

However, recently I’ve been struggling with what’s lacking in our relationship.   I’ve been vocal about what I see is missing and my hopes for where I want our relationship to be at. A few days ago we had an honest conversation about this, and he confessed he knows he hasn’t been treating me how I should and that he’s currently unable to meet some of the needs I have. Due to his insanely busy schedule, it just seems he doesn’t have time for me/our relationship as much as I would like. I also think they way we express care and affection are vastly different- and often I wished I received more.   The problem is, I worry that I am asking for too much and being too needy. I’ve been questioning how much I should compromise what I want in a relationship versus being with the man I am absolutely in love with. I wonder if I just need to be patient to see if things eventually change … or do I step away and hope one day I find someone who can provide more?  I am incredibly conflicted.

We’ve been dating for two years so I’m scared to end it but I think it may be time.    He isn’t a man I can see myself marrying. I’ve imagined him proposing several times and I never say yes. I want kids and I feel like he’d be a bad example if we have any. He screams at me for irrational reasons, one example being we went to play soccer and he got angry because I was better than him. So he threw my phone at me and proceeded to scream at me for hours.    He yells at me in front of our friends and family which i find humiliating. If he has a problem, shouldn’t he tell me in private? He gets into fights with his family right in front of me who, by the way, called me incompetent and instead of defending me, he told me I was incompetent.    We went on a trip recently and he told me it was boring because I don’t drink or smoke with him. He can’t have fun unless he’s under the influence. He spent half the trip complaining. It was only a three day trip. And whenever I ask him to take photos of me he says I look stupid and is too lazy to take more than one.    EVERYTIME i tell him something that ends up being wrong he glares at me and asks me “what are you talking about???” In a snarky way and it’s ruining my self esteem. He claims he loves me and yes he protects and cooks for me all the time but my friends say some of the things he says are emotionally abusive. I’m so tired. Last week he fought with his mother over the phone almost every day because she got tired of his temper and he told me I was the only thing that calmed him down and that he only feels like he can be himself around me. So I feel responsible for him because I’m scared of what will happen if I leave him.    I tried to ask him to go to therapy but he would retort “I don’t need therapy. people are soft and that’s bullshit”. Whenever I have a problem with him he gaslights me to the point I end up apologizing. Always. I tried to talk to him about this a few days ago. I called him and told him I don’t feel connected to him anymore and asked if he could see us living together in the future. He said yes but when I tried to tell him my concerns he said “this is the kind of bullshit that makes guys wish they were single”. He also threatened to break up with me one time because I got annoyed with him and he gave me an insincere apology. After I hung up because he wasn’t willing to work with me, he called me back and yelled at me for a few hours about how I was dragging on the argument and that if I did it again I would be single.    Another time we were supposed to meet after his work and he decided to leave work early WITHOUT telling me. Unfortunately I got a stomachache and asked if we could reschedule. What did he do? He called me and yelled at me for “fucking with his job”.    I CANT tell if I’m being too soft or if he’s bad for me.    I avoid his texts. Sometimes I “forget” to call him back. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells. Sure I’m insecure but he makes it worse by invalidating my feelings all the time. His friend called me ugly as a joke but it hurt my feelings and instead of defending me he told my friend it was cool and to just apologize when he had the chance. Then he got mad at me for causing trouble.    And during one of our arguments he yelled at me “b\*tch you’re ugly”. I want to forgive but I don’t know how.    Any advice would be appreciated. My question is: would it be better to break up?",1

Things were wonderful up until the last month. He was struggling with his anxiety about where his life is headed and I feel like it ultimately self sabotaged our relationship. We started having petty little fights that escalated more than they should’ve and I couldn’t quite seem to reassure him of my love. On the morning of my birthday he picked a fight, canceled prior plans to celebrate my bday together, and ended it within 30 minutes of me waking up. Over text. No call (he refused to pick up). The whole thing felt aggressive and quick—no goodbye or any type of closure. I was already blocked/unfollowed on everything after an hour. Wtf. Sad and shocked is an understatement, because he was incredibly sweet and caring for the 2 years I’ve known him.

How Do I Get A Happy Marriage Now?",1568,11i93e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/11i93e2/i_21f_have_fallen_in_love_with_my_arranged/,638,2023-03-04 18:25:01,relationship_advice,"&#x200B;  My (21F) and my husband’s (28M) marriage was an arranged one between our parents. I was 16, and he was 23 when they forced us together. I don’t want to get into the ethics of this because I know it’s bad, and even though it’s their culture, their views are cruel and incredibly sexist. Luckily, my husband was a good man and compared to most of my friends, my marriage was peaceful. He never hit me or treated me like a slave and I’m so grateful to be married to him instead of anyone else. Our first year was incredibly painful because both our parents demanded grandchildren and neither of us was strong enough to resist them.  Luckily, we only had to have sex about 5 times for me to get pregnant with twins, and I thoroughly hated it so much that after we got the positive result, he promised never to touch me again. Something that most men wouldn’t have done. It was so painful for me that I was crying every time. I don’t blame him too much for the bad experience because we were both virgins, but that week was enough for me to never want sex again. After my sons were born in a thankfully easy birth, we stayed in our country until I was 18 before he got a job in Canada, something we have been after since our marriage. He’s a doctor and a really good one.  We left our family and moved here. And we were finally free. And neither of us wants to go back. Me for obvious reasons, and him because he’s 5th of 11 siblings and his entire family is horrible like my parents. He offered me a divorce if I wanted, so I could have a new life. But I have no education, so I can not work and I have 2 sons that need their father so even though I didn’t love him, I stayed and told him as much. We became more like friends, and our marriage only existed on paper, but he was never bad to me. He gave me money to spend and would buy me things, and I would cook him his favorite food and keep the house nice for him, and do all the chores. Our children never knew that their parents didn’t love each other because we were always nice to each other.  And when we got here, I asked him if I could get an education so he enrolled me in a local university to study business. I’m almost done now, so I can start working and actually do something besides go crazy in my house.  My sons started daycare after we came here so that they would learn English, and I started to get really bored so I downloaded a bunch of apps on my phone, because he bought me a brand new iPhone, and that’s how I found reddit, which I have been using to practice my casual English. I’m using a throwaway account because I don’t want my actual account to get attention because of this post.  After a few months here, he sat me down and told me that he had urges that only a woman could fill, but he didn’t want to hurt me and wouldn’t force me to do anything. He asked for my permission to have sex with other women, and I said yes. As long as he hid it from other people and our kids, I don’t care what he did. He would go out every Friday and come back happy, and I was just happy that he was satisfied. I didn’t love him, but I cared for him like I would a friend.  When COVID-19 started in mid-2020, I got very sick early. He pulled a lot of strings so I could get the best care in the hospital he worked at. I was useless for almost a month and a half, and he was amazing. He looked after my needs, kept my sons happy, and worked at the same time.  What sparked my love was something he did when I was in really bad pain. I was at home then, but I still couldn’t really do anything without getting out of breath. It was night time and he was helping me get into bed, but I was struggling for some reason and my entire body was painful. I was trying really hard not to cry and he noticed. He picked me up, sat down on the bed and laid my head on his lap. He started to stroke my hair while singing to me until I fell asleep, and when I woke up, he had fallen asleep in that position because I was sleeping on him. I didn’t want to wake him so I covered him with a blanket and hugged him until he woke up an hour later. He was so tender with me when I was sick that I fell in love, and even after I was cured, he was still so kind to me.  When I’m grumpy, he makes me coffee, when I’m sad he hugs me, and he does so many other things that show that he cares about me. When I went through a period after my sickness where I thought I was ugly, he started to tell me I was beautiful several times during the day. Something he still does. I started to work out with him last summer, and I know it seems a bit boastful, but I think I’m really attractive now. Men started to flirt with me, and even though I would never stray, he is always so protective of me. It just makes me love him more.  And he’s so good to our sons too. So patient and helpful, even though it’s not his duty. I don't remember a single conversation I had with my father where he didn't yell at me. But when my husband talks to my sons, he is so gentle and kind.  But he doesn’t love me. I was touching him a lot more, and he started to hug me before work, and after I asked, he even started to sleep in the same bed and cuddle me. He rests his head on my chest and I pet his hair until he falls asleep, and even the way he breathes on me is just perfect. I don’t know how to describe it, but I think he looks the most attractive while asleep in my arms.  Covid was the best thing that ever happened to me because I fell in love with my husband. But after the lockdown ended he started to go out every Friday again. And every time he leaves after our children go to sleep, my heart would hurt. I hate that he sleeps with other women, even though it’s my fault. And I know that he would stop if I asked, but it would be selfish of me to deny his urges when I can’t satisfy him. He even asked me after lockdown ended if I was okay with him still going out. And I wanted to say no, but I said yes and then ended up crying myself to sleep while holding his shirt that Friday night.  A few weeks ago, I followed him and watched him go out for dinner with a beautiful blonde woman. They were flirting so much, and they had sex in his car while I spied on them. We have 2 cars, and he uses that one only for his dates, so that me and my sons will never notice anything. Then they went to a cheap hotel with her for 3 hours. They were on the first floor with the window open, and I watched them do so many things, in so many positions that I felt dirty for spying. But I was also so jealous of that woman. He texted me that he was coming home, something he always does even though I’m usually asleep. I drove back home before he came out and made him a snack. He was surprised that I was awake and asked if I was waiting for him, and I asked him how it was. He was uncomfortable talking about it, but I just wanted to know more so he told me everything. Her name, that he tries to hire her at least once a month, what they do, and so much more. He calls a company and he hires a girl from them every weekend. He tries to get the blonde because she's his favorite because she never says no to anything he asks.  I want him to do all those dirty things to me, but at the same time I remember how much it hurt, and I don’t want to do it.  If I tell him that I love him, I know that he would stop going out, and he won’t be as happy. And I also don’t know how to have sex because the last time I did it was when I was 16. He won’t enjoy it with me because I can’t do the things I saw the other woman do.  But watching him enjoy other women from the side because I gave him permission stabs my heart every time he goes out.  How do I tell him that I love him without hurting myself, or making him less happy?  TLDR: I fell in love with my husband, who I am in an arranged marriage with, except I hate sex and gave him permission to sleep with other women. Now I don’t know how to tell him I want him to stop.  &#x200B;  Edit: I am very sorry because I made a typo and we don’t have 3 cars, we have 2 cars. One is a nice minivan for my sons, and the other is a used sedan that he uses as his personal one and my sons aren’t allowed in it. We aren’t rich enough to own 3 cars or have room for 3. Our driveway is so narrow that we have to park them in a line and the sedan is almost in the road.  To those of you who think this is fake, I am happy that your life is so normal that something like this seems like a story. I would do anything to exchange with you. And thank you for complimenting my English! Reddit was very helpful.  We talked last night, and it was kind of bittersweet. I told him how I felt and showed him the post, and he got really sad. He didn’t know it hurt me that much, or that I was so attracted to him. And unfortunately, he doesn’t actually love me and is just really nice. I should have seen this coming because back home he was always really affectionate with his friends like holding hands and hugging them. Holding hands with friends is normal where we come from and isn’t a romantic gesture. He actually thought that all our physical touching was just platonic, and he never had romantic ideas. His touching made me happy, and he enjoyed touching me, so he was happy to do it. And he didn’t like seeing me sad, so that was why he started complimenting me and doing nice things. And the protectiveness is because he has seen terrible things happen to women in our country even if they are wearing proper clothes, and is worried that it would happen to me here too if he doesn’t protect me. I wear Western clothing now, and it makes him afraid that someone will try to hurt me.  But he is open to actually having a relationship with me and we are going on a date on Friday! I am so excited for it, and I’ve been smiling all day just thinking about it!  He asked me to come up with a list of things I want to do, and he would do the same and when he gets home today we are going to compare them.  He said that most of you were right, and that sex with me would be different since he doesn’t feel a connection with anyone he hires, but if he falls in love with me as well it would be way better. But he doesn’t want to do it right away because we have to warm up to it, and it shouldn’t be something that is rushed. He told me not to worry if I can’t do the things they can do, and that it is the person that matters not the act itself.  Thank you all for the advice!",1

Fifth hour (around 11AM) was starting and of course everyone had first day nerves. When I entered my Environmental Sciences class I noticed the teacher had set up the seating chart by last name. I was a G name so I was up front and in between two names I didn’t know. Oh well. I sat down and got everything I would need out.   I heard some friends come in and waved and started talking to them. Suddenly a group of boys walk in, they’re loud and having fun. Going off their jerseys they are some of the freshmen boys who made Varsity teams in football and Wrestling. As they noisily debate their seats with our teacher (a football coach) one calls out a really basic insult/joke I’ve gotten from my last name my whole life. He wants to know who it is. I ignored the buffoon bc I’m not responding to a rude “joke” from someone I don’t know. Especially one where he’s loudly looking for the *guy* it belongs to. So my darling friend behind me goes “well, *she* is right here.”  Of course the room goes quiet as I turn around to see this near 6’0ft brunette haired behemoth of a freshman boy w/ piercing blue eyes stare me down and slowly starts to smile.  Forgetting his friend he walks over and confidently introduces himself; “I’m B, looks like we will be lab partners this yr.” I stare at him for a moment bc this is clearly a sick joke. I’m a 5’0 nothing, orchestra nerd and good grade student that this butt head of a teacher gave his star player to to babysit. Great.  So I nod and send him a smile.  His friend just so happens to be on the other side of me. Because God is funny like that.   So class starts and these two freshmen giants keep pushing into me so they can talk while I try to take notes. I finally scoot my chair back and just figure I’m gonna write using my lap. Nope. My teacher stops his lesson, chuckles and tells the boys they need to make room bc they’re scaring me out of my seat. (I was not scared, annoyed yes, but not scared.)  B looks at me, smiles a blinding smile that just screamed I was going to regret going to school that day and proceeds to lift me up and set me in his lap and lock his arms around my waist before proclaiming he’d fixed the problem. My teacher was gobsmacked bc who does that?! I was so surprised my brain forgot I was human and I turned into an opossum and decided to freeze. Luckily the bell for lunch rang and I nearly made B infertile removing myself from the room as fast as possible.   Get to the lunch room and for some reason his table is next to mine. Friends we had separately, who didn’t know each other, chose the tables. I ignored his stare the entire lunch.  Get back to class in my own seat and here comes B. He sits down and pauses before looking at me and says, “Can I have your number?” I’m pretty sure my face was like ‘wtf why?’ And he proceeded to explain it was for lab partner issues. So he got it right as class ended.   The next few weeks go by fairly peacefully honestly. He minds his manners and we found that we actually got along pretty well. He was loud where I was quite and he was outspoken where I was reserved. Our entire class was getting along well and it became many of our favorite class. It felt like a genuinely safe place. Which isn’t easy to find at 15… I did notice no matter where we moved seats though, there was B as my partner. Always. Luckily he was actually incredibly smart so “babysitting” was easy as long as his mind stayed out of the gutter. The weeks turned into months and before we knew it, the school year was over. Somehow B has worked his way into my best friend spot.   For the next three years he was my best and closest friend. Always around, even when I didn’t necessarily want him there. Like when I was the only girl not dating, he’d tell me we could go on dates but from how I viewed it he was just being kind. The ugly friend was what I figured I was. But senior yr we had a fight when he found out I was asked out by an older guy from a different school. He exploded saying the guy wasn’t good enough. I told him he wasn’t my family and he wasn’t my keeper and to butt out. Well he was right. The boy sucked and he ended up getting physical with me when we broke up. I lied and told everyone I hit my head on my car door but I could tell B knew something. So suddenly the fight was over. We had more tension than before but I had my best friend back finally. I was also excited that I was moving across the country for school. B was supportive but sad. All my friends were.   Jump forward a yr and I had to rush home bc my mom became deathly sick. I left school and came home. I didn’t tell anyone for weeks due to depression and the unknown but one night B called me and said he wished we could hang out. He missed me and wanted to see me so he could support me better. So I surprised him and met him after work at the lake near his house.   When he got out of his truck smiling I thought my heart momentarily quit working. That measly year had changed my best friend. He wasn’t the silly boy I had left behind. Now he was a full grown and incredibly handsome man. I’m not gonna lie, I ran strait into those arms and cried like a baby for hours. while he held me in the back of his truck bed while we watched the dark lake. I told him I needed something funny to cheer myself up when I had calmed down and stopped using one of the blankets as an impromptu napkin for tears. He looked at me gently and asked “Anything?” I agreed.   He took a deep breath and started in on a story about how freshman year of high school he fell in love at first sight with this girl. (At this point I almost stopped him bc I didn’t want to hear about him with another girl.) He explained how he had called “dibs” the very first day at lunch, how he made his friends spread the word that said girl was off limits or he would fix the problem himself. He blushed as he told me he had made a deal with our teacher that if he kept getting nothing lower than an A on tests he would continue to allow B to sit next to me in class & wouldn’t give me a different partner. Then he explained how the time never felt right to ask her to go out and before he knew it they had graduated and she left him behind. He got quite and I thought that was it. (I was honestly a little irked he had wanted to tell me about his love life still.) Then he sighed, squeezed me a lil deeper into our hug and told me how happy he was to finally have her back in his arms again.   I’m not going to lie. My brain quit working. If he said steam was coming out of my ears I’d have believed it. I turned around so quick wide eyed and shocked.   “This time I’m just going to ask you to go out with me.”   When I realized about ten minutes later *I* was dibs girl I asked if that’s why no one ever asked me out bc I had heard guys had had some interest.  Looking mighty embarrassed he put his head on my shoulder and told me he knew it was juvenile and he was sorry. Before proceeding to look me in the eyes and say “I’ve been a part of your past and I really want to be in your future. Please let me.”   I’ve been married to B for going on 5 yrs now, loving each other for 7.5 & best friends for 12. Love is hard and it can be confusing. But it’s so worth it.",1

We get to see each other once a month, usually for about 48 hours. It never feels long enough but I cherish the time so deeply.   This past weekend he visited me. We’d been going through a rough patch recently and were both emotionally drained. When he got here, he wrapped himself around me and laid his head on my chest. I held him and he fell asleep. In that moment I felt so happy that I could be his peace and that he felt at home falling asleep in my arms. It made me remember that no matter what, as long as we love each other we will get through.   So often I feel pressured to make all these plans when he visits. To fill the weekend with activities and to make the most of our time together. But it’s just as valid to be able to simply hold each other and nap and feel at home. I truly cannot wait until we’re able to do that every night.",1

When we first started dating I thought he was extremely handsome however now I notice anytime I look at him I just think that he's unattractive.  He hasn't changed in weight or in looks since we've started dating.  He's the sweetest most caring guy in the world who's truly my best friend and he makes me feel like the most gorgeous woman alive . I feel awful in my thoughts when I see him because he's truly such a wonderful man. Lately I've noticed that I feel disgusted whenever he kisses me or tries to hold my hand etc. But I laugh so much with him and I love just cuddling on the couch while watching movies . I feel like I'm being unfair as he hasn't done anything to warrant this and he's even started noticing lately despite the fact I've had these thoughts for months.  I seen him today for the first time in 2 weeks since I had exams and I noticed I just felt awkward around him at first . I warmed up to him gradually but I feel guilty in the fact that I wasn't excited to see him, it was just another aspect of my day . I have no desire to cheat but find other men attractive and don't understand why I can't find him good looking especially since I've used to . He's so great though and I don't necessarily want to end things , but I feel like he's blaming himself for this and that's not fair. Should I break up with him ?

I (F21) think I'm in love with my roommate (F21). We only started rooming together last semester and we made plans to do so for next school year too, but man, these feelings are getting to me and every day it's harder to push them down. I really love everything about her, her artistic talents, her smile, her laugh, how she enjoys spending time with me even if that just means sitting together on the couch or going to the gas station. We spend a lot of time together, usually watching shows during dinner or sharing space while doing homework, but we do other things together too like getting ice cream, going to the park or mall together, and just finding ways where we can occupy each other's space.  Before spring break, I made her a playlist with a good amount of love songs on them, as well as some of both of our favorite songs and I know she listened to it a lot over spring break. Sometimes I feel she might feel the same way, but I'm not sure if it's because she likes me or because she's just that comfortable around me. She lets me cuddle up to her on the couch, hold her hand, just be all touchy-feely with her in a way I think of as romantic but she just expects from me now and doesn't mind. She also doesn't bat an eye or care when most people assume we're dating because of our comfort around each other, such as sitting with each other and laughing during events, having inside jokes, that sort of thing. I want to tell her how I feel but I don't want it to be awkward if she rejects me especially since we'll be living together for longer than just this semester.  I've thought about broaching the subject but as I said, I'm nervous. I know she likes men and women but doesn't want to label her sexuality, partly because she doesn't really feel like a label would fit her but also because I know she grew up in a homophobic religious household, and so entering into a romantic relationship with a woman may be hard for her. I both want and don't want to confess, I'm just at a loss. I haven't felt this way about someone before, just so connected to her in a way that's so profound and lovely. Anyway, any advice? I know this sounds cliche but I just wish I knew if she liked me in more than a platonic way.",1

So my wife of 8 years told me last night that she does not have the same feelings for me and she loves me less. She feels like we are drifting apart and that she feels like a mum/maid in our house not a wife.  She says she feels like the everyday is the same for her. Go to work, come home, make dinner, parent our son and then go to bed an do it again. On the weekends she takes our son to swimming and then comes home and cleans the house and then Sunday we do food shopping or something similar then home. She feels like its not a partnership and she is having to do all this work and never gets a break.  She said she feels like she had this feeling for over 6 months now and it is not changing. She just doesn't feel the love between us anymore.   One of these reasons is because she feels like I do not do enough around the house the help out, hence why she feels like a mum/maid not a wife, or a partnership. I try my best to assist but I know I'm a lazy person and there are somethings that she doesn't like me doing because I don't do it properly. She also said that she doesn't feel like i show appreciation for all the work she puts in. However i do, i just must not be very good at showing this and its taking its toll.  Also she feels like she doesn't have an outlet and she is just stuck in this cycle. She lets me play golf on the weekends so she said i get an outlet but not her.  To be honest I know where she is coming from and i fully support her desires, i would be more that happy to support her if she wanted to do something on weekends like a sport or seeing friends or whatever she wants to do.  We have booked in to see a councillor and start that which I'm excited for but she seems less excited.  There are things I have to work on which I know is going to be hard but I'm willing to do it and fight because I love her so much. I've been blindsided to be honest and i feel so sick in my stomach and I'm scared that the councilling wont work and i will lose her.    any advice to ease my brain would be much appreciated.  --- **tl;dr**: wife feels less love for me because she feels she is in a cycle and I don't support her enough and it's affecting her feelings towards me.

Primary-Art-4604,My (37/m) wife (36/f) went through a major transformation and no longer thinks she wants to be with me unless I change,122,13y5h1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13y5h1x/my_37m_wife_36f_went_through_a_major/,166,2023-06-02 06:58:29,relationships,"I've never had to do this before, so hopefully I make this coherant.  &#x200B;  I've been with my wife for 14 years - we nearly fell instantly in love, and spent all of our time together.  I proposed shy of three years together in the fall, and we got married the following summer.  We have three amazing kids together who we are both fully in love with.  We live a relatively simple life - I work at a well-paying corporate job, she had held multiple jobs over the years and has always felt a strong sense of success.  I wish I could say the same for me - I graduated college at once of the worst times for my generation and struggled with finding a solid career path. After a few years (before I proposed), I was lucky enough to get a temp job working for a Fortune 100 company and worked my way up over time.  I never enjoyed my work, but always worked my butt off to be as successful as possible, knowing that there's always a  next thing  to shoot for.  &#x200B;  Mild story break, but very important.  Throughout both of our lives, my wife and I have struggled with our weights.  I have spent the majority of my life very overweight (don't think 'My 600 Pound Life', but the really really fat guy you see at a pool), and she has always been very overweight as well.  We've worked on our weights throughout our relationships (I was actually in relatively good shape when we met) but neither of us have ever had continued success.  She actually had lap band early in our relationship (before marriage) and ended up having all the fluid removed in the second year, rendering the device useless.  That being said, I never loved her any less and always made sure she knew this.  &#x200B;  Last year, my wife had another (different) bariatic procedure done.  For anyone not familiar with these surgeries, these are not taken lightly in the medical community - months of surgeon appointments, nutritionists, psych evaluations - and she did everything by the book.  I continued to support her as she felt strongly about this.  Since the procedure, she has lost \~70 pounds and is living a very active lifestyle.  &#x200B;  Cutting back to me - a little good news on my career.  I started a new role two years ago, and began to hate it pretty quickly.  Leadership was weak, had no vision, and I was struggling to get through the day - something I saw in one of my previous roles.  The first time, I ended up seeing a psychiatrist and was put on antidepressants.  The antidepressants made it easier to live my life, but as a side effect I began to gain weight.  I had to balance out liking the person I felt like, and the person I looked like.  I ended up being the heaviest I had been in my life, and stopped taking the pills and seeing the doctor (FWIW, I never really liked the doctor, he was fine but seemed like a means to a prescription).  I've come back down in weight and have remained stable since then - but am still morbidly obese.  &#x200B;  I PROMISED good news - at my current job in the last year leadership changed, we re-orged, and leadership is working directly with me to build a career I love.  I didn't think these kind of things could happen, but I'm actually happy with my job - I get up in the morning and look forward to taking on the day.  Over the last few months, I've gone to conferences and I'm building a vision for the work I've been assigned.  This happiness has bloomed in the last three months.  Last week I shared my one year plan for the company with leadership and they were so impressed, they've asked me to bump the plan to three years. I shared this news with my wife and she seemed happy for me.  &#x200B;  This week has been rough, I can tell something has been different with my wife, and she seems distant.  I know she sometimes has extreme hormone swings based on a non-threatening medical condition she has (I want to be very clear, this is a real thing, I'm not trying to be snarky) and assumed she is having an 'episode' - these usually last a few days and her body normalizes itself out. I pulled back being overly emotional with her because it's usually a negative trigger, but after our youngest was asleep she sent the older kids to watch a movie and told me she wanted to talk to me.  &#x200B;  Normally when we have issue with our relationship, we give it a few days and we share what's been bothering both of us.  When she asked to talk, I immediately told her I am willing to talk, but truely have no issues to share with her.  I shared what I just previously shared, which is I believe she's having an episode, and was trying to give her a little space.  She began to tell me that with her weight loss, she has a new found confidence and feels like I'm dragging our family down.  I never take the lead on planning active events for our family - we never have done this in the past - and she doesn't see me putting in the effort to lose weight that she is doing.  I struggle with this for a few reasons:  &#x200B;  1) I don't feel like bariatric surgery is for me.  I am in no way opposed to it for people who want it, but I don't see bariatric surgery as a solution for me. It's just not my thing and is a major committment.  &#x200B;  2) She has a job where she works limited hours, and works out everyday for two and a half hours.  The gym has child care (for the baby) and once the big kids are on the bus, she goes to the gym and grinds super hard.  I'm very proud of her for the work she puts in and I've shared this with her.  I don't have the time to do that.  I would either need to sacrifice my job (not happening) or go to the gym immediately after work and sacrifice the time with my kids (not ideal, IMO). I HAVE been working out 3-4 mornings a week in the basement, mostly cardio.  &#x200B;  3) She does all the shopping in the house, and she shops relatively clean.  She buys some snacks for the kids - but I don't eat those, and eat what she buys for  us .  I'm sure in theory if I ate 1200 calories a day, I would lose weight, but I'd also drive myself crazy starving.  I've tried every diet there is, and I've never found longterm success.  &#x200B;  She also shared that she feels like I'm holding her back from doing hiking trips (I've never done so, we actually did a multi-night national park trip a few years back where we hiked multiple days) and doing things and **she said she does not know if she can be with me if I don't share her new lifestyle.**  &#x200B;  I was shocked by this as I've supported her in everything she has done in her life, and based on the last eight months, she is willing to throw it all away.  I froze at the opportunity to say I'll do whatever it takes because I don't have the confidence that her goals will be realistic for me (she struggled to really drill down what this all looks like for me).  I ended up at a stalemate, bawled my eyes out, and told her I needed to think about things before I could talk more.  &#x200B;  I spent a few hours reflecting and she said she wanted to talk more.  This is where I'm really at a loss for words.  She started going back to her original points she discussed, but then started bringing up how she was no longer satisfied sexually.  She said sex with me is difficult (she never had a problem when she was larger) and she wants more in her sex life.  She asked me if I would be interested in a threesome - which sounds like every guy's fantasy - but this was the most confusing part for her to bring this up here.  This is something we had joked about a LONG time ago, and she never seemed interested in something like that.  She said that she now fantasizes about someone holding her up during sex and I can't do that for her.  I immediately said that absolutely that's not something I'm into with the context of our current situation.  She then asked me what I thought about being in an open relationship - something we've never talked about, and something that truely hurt me.  Again, for people who are in open relationships, that is fine, but not something I am interested in being a part of.  I completely broke down with this and I feel like my world is collapsing down on me.  I've already taken the day off work tomorrow, and don't even know what to do.  &#x200B;  Am I crazy to not have jumped at her suggestion to  share her new lifestyle ?  I feel like I'm setting myself up for failure by doing so without even really understanding what that is. How do I even go about figuring out what to do next?  I am too embarrassed to talk to my friends about this, do I need a therapist to talk to?  Couples therapy?  I have no idea.  &#x200B;  She's texted me since our last talk saying she loves me and always will, but I don't even know what to say to her back.  &#x200B;  Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.  &#x200B;  TL;DR - My wife has lost a significant amount of weight, and now she says she can't be with me if I can't adopt her  lifestyle ",1

HE IS PERFECT.      We have been only dating 2 months or so and I'm stupid for falling this fast. The other day I was at his house and he was showing me some hoodies excitedly that didn't fit him anymore and he was so happy to give them to me, he had me try on all of them to see how cute I was in them. After he asked me (4'11) to give him (6'1) one of my hoodies, obviously that is ridiculous he wouldn't be able to wear it but he said he didn't care it was mine so he's love it either way. So that night I was showing him some of my options for him one had mickey on it, one had stich on it, and one was a puma hoodie. In all honesty I expected him to choose the puma one cause it would fit his style more even if he wasn't going to use it. He very enthusiastily chose the stich jumper with the biggest smile on his face.      I don't know if it's the way he could hug me for hours without getting bored, or tickles me just cause he likes how my laugh sounds or begs me to stay at his just a little longer or him wearing the flimsy little bracelet I made him 24/7 or even the way we are so comfortable around each other but I love this guy, even if it's too soon or if I don't know what love is, he is someone who I never ever want to leave my life. Maybe it's not love but I know I like him more than I have ever liked anyone before.  TL;DR - I am a teen who is stupid enough to think i know what love is",1

Basically my girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over half a year now and it’s been amazing and I love her a lot. But recently there’s been some strain at least on my side because she doesn’t know how to cook and never has anything to eat at her place and I’m tired of spending money on food for us or spending money on fast food constantly. We both work full time jobs but I am in college online so I have a pretty busy schedule when it comes to finding the time to do my college work along with everything else.  My girlfriend recently has been needing a lot of attention and I just don’t have the time and I don’t have the money to spend on both of us to eat out every day. She never cooks, barely cleans her own apartment, and is constantly wanting to see me every waking minute (which isn’t a problem she just can’t understand that I need time to do my stuff and will get upset when I tell her that). This is really annoying to me and i’m unsure what to do. I fear that if I call her out and tell her i’m tired of her not being able to cook and not being an adult (because i’ve semi-called her out before as a joke and she broke down in tears) she’ll just break down again and I’ll be left feeling like an A hole because I want her to change to better our relationship. Please someone tell me what I should do any advice is appreciated.  EDIT// Just to clear up some common misconceptions that i’ve been seeing constantly. Yes i do cook i cook the most in the relationship. No i don’t clean up her apartment when it’s dirty i just suggest she cleans it which she will do maybe 2 times a month.",1

I have been struggling with finding my soulmate and feeling disheartened by my current situation. Despite my efforts to connect with potential partners through various means, such as matrimonial sites and dating apps, I have not found someone who truly resonates with me. I have even expressed my feelings towards a close friend, but due to caste issues (her family won't agree), that didn't work out either.  I am feeling discouraged and losing hope in finding my life partner. The pressure of societal expectations and the fear of being alone is overwhelming. I know it's important to remember that everyone's journey toward finding love is unique and unpredictable. Perhaps some may say take a break from actively searching for a partner and focus on self-improvement and personal growth. Invest time exploring new hobbies and interests, connecting with like-minded people, and developing a deeper understanding of yourself.

I’m so devastated and don’t know how to even approach this. I (26f) have been dating my boyfriend, Connor (27m) for almost a year now. I’m not proud to admit it but our relationship started off as an affair. He used to be married to my best friend Jenny (26f). We had been best friends since 7th grade and did pretty much everything together. She met Connor during our Sophomore year in College and they began dating. He proposed a year after graduation and they got married soon after. I don’t wanna get into details but to summarize it, we started sleeping with each other a few weeks after their wedding. He told me he regretted getting married so young and felt trapped. Our affair went on for about 7 months until one day Jenny walked in on us. She started crying and screaming about how we betrayed her and how she trusted us. They soon got a divorce and the process was pretty smooth considering Jenny didn’t want anything from him. She cut contact with the both of us and even though I see her often (we live in a small town) we don't speak. I lost a lot of my friends and family when news broke out but I still felt superior to Jenny and felt like I was better than her because her husband chose me over her. I’m extremely ashamed of it now and can’t even understand my thought process.    Fast forward to yesterday night, I was going through Connors phone and looking through his camera roll. I’ve been extremely paranoid about him cheating and have been going through his phone almost every night after he falls asleep. After a while I came to his “hidden folder  and I decided to check it. When I opened it I saw at least 20 exposed pictures of Jenny. I was honestly shocked and didn’t know if I should scream and wake him up or just burst out in tears. I looked at the pictures and after looking at the dates of the photos I knew that they were pictures she’d sent him whilst they were married. I scrolled all the way to the end and the last clip was a video of her going down on him. I’m honestly just speechless and don’t know what to make of this. I don’t understand why or how he still has these pictures. I’ve been crying all day and he’s been asking me what’s wrong. I honestly don’t know what to say and have just been telling him that I’m emotional and on my period. I don’t only feel betrayed but also embarrassed and insecure. I’ll be honest and say that I’ve always been somewhat jealous of Jenny. She’s a lot prettier and has a nice body. Guys would always talk to her instead of me and every time we went out she’d be getting attention. I think that’s why I felt so accomplished and confident when Connor and I started our affair. I guess I felt like I’d finally one-upped her.   I don’t know how I’m supposed to confront him. Should I sit him down and tell him what I saw? Or do I try to contact Jenny and tell her that he still has pictures of her? I don’t think she’d be comfortable knowing he still has those. Maybe we can even talk things out and I can explain my side of the story. I’m honestly just lost and don’t know who to talk to. I don’t wanna tell my friends or family because I’m honestly just embarrassed.   ",1

This always happens. But where are they when you’re down and need support? No where. Or they fuck off until they want to have sex again. And guess what? You’ll let them because at least it’s some attention. They will never love you. You will never find satisfaction in another person. No one will ever be enough for you.  Learn to be enough for yourself. Please tell me one day we like ourselves… I get so attached so fast. Then they get what they want and I’m left picking shit up and I still do it. Over and over and over. Because I get bored or I need to feel something. That’s the addictive personality thing. No, he’s not going to text you today unless you do first. Or unless he gets aroused and needs to use to you to expend himself. And you’ll let me probably because you hate yourself still. And then you’ll expect him to actually start liking you for you and be passionate about you. HA! What a fucking notion.  God I hate myself.   Why is being liked and loved too much to ask for?

Draw a loving line in the sand. 3. Be loving whilst strongly maintaining my boundaries. 4. Be ready to help with actionable support, not a soundboard for moan.fm    My older sister has always been sensitive and as a result, I've felt quite protective of her. We lost our mum as young children and that shit binds you.  For most of her young adult life she was travelling and enjoying herself, trained to be a nurse out of I-dont-know-what-to-do-so-ill-do-this mode - and struck gold. Seems to really work for her being surrounded by a team and helping people etc.  Then she found out that she had inherited our family's cancer gene and made the decision to have a removal and reconstruction surgery 7 years ago.  It was a really difficult time for her. It was also interesting seeing how her network responded, like you don't have cancer but you're choosing to gave preventative surgery - good for you! Rather than, woah that's such a hard decision to make and... anyway - layers!  The outcome was that she didn't feel like anyone felt sorry enough for her or gave her enough support (including her family).  And that is now the theme of her life.  She is single, without kids and not sure where to buy her first home (location wise) - and wants all 3 very desperately. To the point that she can't be happy for people, my other sister just engaged, brother due to be married and another brother due a second baby - all she can really say is that she wants them to be sensitive of her when talking about these milestone moments in their lives.   (I have a dog... she doesn't seem too jealous of that 😏)  She's incredibly reactive to her emotions, can't seem to sit with them and instead needs validation from multiple people.

There's no deadline on her pain or journey through this but I want her to accept her life as it is right now, rather than wishing it was something else - because she's wasting days.  It came to a head this week where she made a shitty comment about me having a partner so 🙃 what? You don't, so I need to feel sorry for you?  This is a huge rant. Sorry.  She has had counselling and various therapies. But seems to be stuck at this point. I want to be there for her but I can't be a crutch, and I also can't hold my tongue for much longer. She's currently not speaking to me ... and I don't feel a huge urge to dig into why. Should I just leave it with her?

He's very sweet, and overall wonderful. Whenever he's away at work (I work remotely), I find myself missing him a lot even though I know he'll be home by the end of the day. Sometimes I'm able to distract myself with other tasks enough that I don't think about it, but other times I feel like I miss him more than I should. I almost feel hopelessly depressed. I know it's irrational, and I'm embarrassed that I feel this way.  I'm not sure if it's partly because I dislike my current job so it makes the day drag on more, or what. I do feel like I miss him most when I'm also working. If it's a day off for me and he happens to be working, while I do still miss him, it's not to the same intensity.   I originally assumed that me missing him was a result of when my husband and I did long distance when we were first dating. We did long distance for a year, and the separation was hell. We were thrilled once the long distance was over, and I figured that any periods of time spent apart after long distance would feel easy in comparison. It strangely almost feels worse now. We've been living together now for roughly 3 years, so I figured things would be different by now.   I'm always happy to send time with him. If there's ever a day that a friend of his wants to spend with him, I never hold him back. As much as I miss him, I always encourage him to go spend time with friends.  I've talked to him about how I feel, and he said that he misses me also when he's at work. He doesn't think I'm clingy, but I feel like I am. I'm reminded of how I felt when I was little and was being dropped off at daycare and I missed my mom while she was gone. Though I asked my mom about my behaviors as a child, and she doesn't recall me having separation anxiety as a child. I was never abandoned as a child, nor was I abused or neglected, so I'm not sure why I feel this way.  Does anyone else miss their partner while they're apart? I know people will recommend that I should receive therapy, and I'm debating on it. Ironically I work in the behavioral health field, but I'm not a therapist that can diagnose myself with anything.

I would like to get some advice about why and what can't I do about it..      When I was 16, I started to talk by message to a girl (C) after passing the baccalaureate, it was June 2019. After talking all the summer with her, we took a little bit of time to pair up but in October 2019 we finally kissed each other for the first time.      I don't really need to describe C but she was just really my type and I felt that she was the ONE. You may know this feeling. Yeah she was my first real love story and we had as good as some bad times during long term but this was really OK.      I really did 2 principal mistakes with her, she wasn't really selfconfident and had some trust issues. Summer 2020 I did my first mistake by hidding her that i took a selfi with another girl.. and the other one was that, I, during University, talked to the only girl that was in my promo ( computering ) when I said I won't, and to be honest this girl was absolutly not someone I could have something with. I was just too stupid to tell her those things and hidden it until she knew.      Those mistakes weren't really big but I know that they are a part of why we broke up.      From october 2020 to february 2021 here is what happened : I made already those two mistakes I've talked about just before. We made love for the first time and it was also the first time I and she did it, the relationship starts to get a bit unconfortable as she thinks that's I don't give her enough attention and because my main friends at this time are 3 girls ( yeah but I swear they were just friends) she's upset when I go out with them, and finally, february we broke up and decided to take distance because we were just incompatible ( the decision was made by both ).      When I say incompatible, I mean that she was the type of person that spend all time with her boyfriend ( she said that we should share EVERYTHING even with friend etc.. ) where I said that we were young and could have some private time. Of course I can't blame her for that and we just took distance.      OK but know, april 2021, I deleted her from all social medias, and I was still thinking about her so I had the habits to go and look at her instagram when I saw that she just paired up with her best friend from past years ! To be honest I've never been jealous of him, during our relationship he was really just a friend of her even if I'm pretty sure that he was already in love. The thing is it has been only 2 months that we broke up and she was already in couple.. Yeah, it was painful.      Maybe 4-5 month after, I text her back to take some news. We talked normally and I had still this love feeling inside me, but I didn't know what was up with her. Some friends of mine told me that it was ok and that it could take time to stop thinking about her. In 2022, I'm still thinking about this relationship and I still having this feeling that she is the one.      I was always thinking about the past and I started to get uncomfortable about the fact that we did our first time together. I tried to talk to other girl, with one I think it could have end up to something, but I still had the feeling that it was cheating on C. I don't know why.      Recently I kissed a girl after a party and I really felt guilty even tho I'm single ..      Today, I don't know why I still have that feeling and some times I want to talk with her again. I know this might be wrong. But still today, I can not imagine living with another woman than her and have this feeling that I can't fell in love with someone else even if she is with someone.  TL;DR : 2 years after being in a 1 year relationship I have the feeling that I cannot go through it and that she is still the one. I was 17 when I paired up with her and it was my first relationship. Also she paired up with her best friend 2 months after we broke up. And today i still think about it even tho I had some adventures ( flirts and kisses ) with other girl which only made me feel guilty.        What should I do ? Continue trying to forget about her ? Or talk about it with her? Thanks for help.",1
AnxiousWinder,I (36M) love my wife (34F) dearly but sex with her doesn't seem to be an option anymore and I am really unsure what to do.,37,1291qdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1291qdd/i_36m_love_my_wife_34f_dearly_but_sex_with_her/,84,2023-04-01 22:53:25,relationships,"It would take almost pages of explanation to really give the full context, but my wife and I have really taken a beating over the last few years.  We've been dealing with some health complexities, a terrible loss in the family, a lot of changes after COVID, and much more.  My wife and I have managed to come out of the worst of things largely unscathed and after a few years of things not making sense and not being any fun, things are relatively normal again.  Except for one thing: My wife just has no interest in sex anymore.  It's kind of a myriad of issues and really, all of them are understandable.  She's had some health issues which has left her in a state where it's not really enjoyable to her that much anymore, she's getting back into her career and that leaves her both physically and mentally tired a lot, and I think after all that we've had to deal with, it's just really difficult for her to be mentally in that space.  I have been very supportive of her in the last year while this has been an issue, and I feel like I have put forth my best effort to find other ways to be intimate.  We do a lot of date nights, take overnight trips elsewhere, I work hard at home to make her feel special, all sorts of things like that.  I think it has kept us very emotionally close, maybe more so than ever.  But I would be lying if I said that I could give up on sex like she has.  It's really started to drive me crazy in the past three months or so.  It's caused me some weird varieties of emotional distress and I really don't know what to do about it.  We've continued to see a couples therapist in the last year or two after we fought our way through a lot of challenges, and they've recommended rekindling emotionally, which is why I've put in the work I detailed above.  But I still can't quite get my wife over the point to get her ready for it again.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  I feel like I am doing everything I can but at this point it feels like anything else is outside of my control.  I fully intend on staying with my wife for life, but something has to change before I just completely lose my mind.  Anyone have any suggestions?  --- **tl;dr**: My wife and I have had a really tough time for a number of years now but we've seemingly finally come out the other end where things are better.  Except she's now completely uninterested and unable to be there for anything sexual.  I want to be with her for life and will continue to be supportive but I still am losing my mind and need to figure something out.",1

We lost ourselves in our relationship and he had no self control and had to seek elsewhere outside from our relationship 3 times while I’ve been loyal 100%. We tried to make it work only if he goes to therapy and change but I realized I deserve better. I ended up telling him upon further consideration I need to put myself first. I’m going back to school this fall and starting a career oriented path and he has his own career in the music industry which he’s trying to get off the ground. With living together for almost 3 years, I realized we both have a lot of unhealed stuff to work through. I want to settle down eventually and have kids and he was always so unsure of it. By far this is the hardest thing I’ve ever done but I need to put myself first. I owe it to myself. I know I’m young and have a lot to look forward to.  We are best friends and want to continue being friends. Our family back grounds are connected and don’t want to spoil that. We both are mutually agreeing to try to live together we just signed a lease to our new place last month… thankfully we have two rooms and well we plan on doing that for a while. Sharing a dog and being friends first sucks through this.   After our conversation I felt a huge weight off my shoulders and my intuition tells me it’s the right thing but today when I woke up with him on the couch and me on our bed alone and it all just hit me at once. I couldn’t believe the life I was envisioning these past 5 years were just a delusion. I thought I’d spend the rest of my life with him. I dreamt of a life with kids with him. I was willing to work through anything except cheating.  I forgive him as a friend but can no longer trust him as a lover. I can accept the situation for what is is and learn from my mistakes.  I love him as a friend but not in love with him anymore and he feels the same. I think we can be amicable until I can move back home or our lease ends and we slowly ease our way into going our own ways?   I cannot handle no contact — my nervous system gets so dis regulated… I drive myself insane. We both plan on being roomies for a while. Is this crazy? Can we actually pull this off? I’ve been checked out… I just feel like I’ve been grieving the relationship all day today while knowing it’s the right thing to do.   Would it be okay to just share a bed until he can afford a new one for the second room? We’re not even sexually compatible anymore … so I’m not that worried about it. I’m pretty interested in working on myself before I have sex again lol     TDLR; Broke up amicably but signed lease last month. Sleeping alone but only have one bed and he’s on the couch. We want to be friends as we are no longer in love but can still talk it up like friends before. Could this be possible ? A slow ease into separation? We both cannot do no contact at all . We just have new boundaries in place now like other roommates.",1

We met 2 weeks and a half ago. We have talked non-stop for these weeks. One day we talked from 3PM to 4AM. We message each other all the time and we have so much in common. We only live 2 and a half hours away from each other. Our humor is the exact same, and so many things are so similar. We have told each other so many personal things and we send pics to each other all the time. Anyway, tonight me and her were talking (about 10 minutes ago we stopped). We started at like 7PM and talked until now, 5 hours later. We talked earlier too. We got done having some weird shitposty conversation about Among Us and we started talking about our connection we feel afterwards. She kept referring to her very strong feelings for me. She didn't use the word  love , but in my mind she was referring to it by calling it  strong feelings  and  mutual feelings . I'm now not sure if she was, and I'm so confused. After we talked about our feelings for each other, I said  (her name), I'll be honest. I love you. I hope this isn't too early, but I really do feel such a connection to you. . She responded with  I just teared up omg . She then said  I love you too! It feels so early but i love every single thing about you . Something about the exclamation point and the comment about it being early made my stomach hurt. I got the feeling she was taken aback and was surprised I would say it so early. I then proceeded to say  I really hope that wasn't too soon. I don't want to come off as creepy or weird. . She then said,  no, you said what I've been thinking. . Soon after saying a few random things, she said  I'm so tired rn, we should go to sleep . We almost always go to sleep at the time she sent that, midnight, so that wasn't necessarily an indicator of anything, and we do have school tomorrow so theres that. Anyway, I feel like an idiot. I searched up frantically after saying  gn  how early is too early to say it. And I saw that most people wait 6-8 months. I felt like throwing up. I feel like I've ruined it. We were planning on meeting on the 29th for lunch, and then on June 2,3,4 for a date where we'd stay at a hotel. I feel like I've fucked up, but in the moment I really thought she was trying to say that. Have I ruined it? Does she think I'm love bombing and trying to manipulate her? I feel sick rn. Maybe I'm overthinking this though. K, if you see this, bc I know you said you use Reddit, I don't know what to say other than that I promise I am not a weirdo who's just lusting for you. I feel so attracted to you. Reddit people, please tell me if I'm a fucking idiot for saying it or if I'm a fucking idiot for overthinking.  TL;DR I may have said I love you too soon to a girl I met 2 and a half weeks ago.",1

He's currently drunk but not sloppy and is away from me - he's rung me twice today and kept in touch throughout the day (just to give you an idea of our relationship).  &#x200B;  So a bit of backstory: I said I loved him quite early on (around \~3 weeks in). I am a very expressive person and think I feel things quite strongly hence why I said it so early. Anyway, when I first told him I loved him, he didn't say it back but I told him that it isn't a race and I don't expect him to say it if he isn't there yet. I should probably add we've only been together for a couple months.  &#x200B;  Now, normally I am the type of person that would freak out at not being told I love you back but his actions are more than proving to me that he does love me so I don't feel particularly anxious or worried about this. He also slipped up and said  love you  to me the other day when we said bye to each other, but he said that didn't count hahaha. Since then, he's said to me stuff like  I'm waiting for the time to be right  and  Just you wait, girly  when we've joked about the fact he accidentally said it.  &#x200B;  OK so fastforward to now: I just got off the phone with him after telling him I loved him before I go to bed. Bear in mind, I do not put any expectation on him to say it back. He always seems to positively respond to when I say it, so I do not \*think\* this is making him uncomfortable. I think he likes to hear it. Anyway, as he hung up he said  I can't wait to say it  which has REALLY thrown me off cause like if that's how you feel then why not just say it? Am I missing something here? Is this a red flag or am I just worringly needlessly? (Diagnosed GAD btw).  &#x200B;  TLDR: Boyfriend acts like he loves me but hasn't said love you back yet. He just said he  can't wait to say I love you  so why does he not just say it?!",1

He is my first boyfriend and we met during our second year in college. I really love our relationship. I never thought that my first boyfriend would be such a loving and caring person.   To preface, before I started dating my boyfriend I was heavily into creative type hobbies such as digital art, animation and 3d sculpting. I still am. I spent ALOT of my time before our relationship doing these hobbies and it genuinely brought me alot of joy to create and learn new things in these topics. However, as we started dating, I started participating less in these activities, to the point where I don't do them at all anymore.   I knew that with getting into a relationship, would come with me having to distribute my time more to my partner, which I was fully prepared to do. But with college work combined with a relationship, I barely have time for any of my interests.   I really love spending time with my boyfriend, I also recently started gaming with him often, but I've also lost motivation to attempt my usual hobbies again.    I've expressed this to my boyfriend a few months ago and he reassured me that I should take time to do my hobbies again and that I shouldn't think that he'll be upset if I don't join him to do certain things. It was sweet of him to say but it bothers me that he has never brought up anything about my interests in this time we've been dating in ways like  oh why don't you do ABC anymore, you used to love doing that . Like he knows how much I used to do these activities before we dated (we were friends before), and I do absolutely none of them anymore. Has he not noticed that I don't speak about any of it anymore? Does he not care to ask?  I brought it up again today, as I recently attempted candle making and it sparked that excitement in being creative again. I told him that I want to try different creative things to get motivated again and all he said was  I feel like it's my fault you don't do alot of these things anymore . What was I even supposed to say? I just dismissed it.  I keep saying that I'll get back into my hobbies but I just don't, and I feel like my skills are gone to shit in this idle time anyways.

My gf and I have been dating for 6 months now and our relationship has grown significantly since. When we met, she had just gotten out of a long term relationship (8years) and so had I. Her ex (Tom) Had gotten rather dependent on her for financial help towards the end of their relationship but was not showing signs of being romantically invested and that ultimately was what motivated her decision to break up.  When we started dating, she made it apparent that she has a few friends from years back that she has grown rather close to and majority of them are guys. A group of about 4 guy friends and they are all mutual friends. As I would assume it would be for most guys, I was a little uncomfortable with that fact but chose to give her and her friends the benefit of the doubt in believing what they have, truly is a genuine friendship.  Case 1: About a month ago, I learnt that she has been sending Tom money periodically upon request from him. He would make up stories like he needs fuel money, his mother is sick, he lost his work computer, his car got broken into and robbed, his phone got stolen etc. How valid those tales are, I will never know, but if that is always your only motivation to speak to your ex, then according to me, it is safe to assume that you only see her as a walking atm you used to date. One afternoon, I brought her lunch to work, sadly found her in not the best of moods, when I asked what is bothering her, she told me that Tom had just called earlier in the day with another sob story and he had asked her for some money. She then admitted to having sent him money just a few weeks prior because he had said his phone had been stolen so she sent him money to buy one which he had not to date. I try my hardest to stay out of her interactions with Tom as she has made it clear that though they have broken up, she still deeply cares for him and can not let him struggle if she can do anything to help. However, on that day, I chose to tell her that I truly think that he is using her for money and does not seem to care about her wellbeing. This is clear in their interactions as he only reaches out to her wheh he needs money. Which is pretty much all the time. I ended it by telling her that ultimately the choice is hers but I hate to see her being used. We then agreed that she would stop sending him money regardless of whatever story he comes up with. Still on this phone matter, when he initially reached out to tell her he needed help with a phone, she then resorted to asking me about phone prices under the guise of wanting to purchase a secondary phone for herself. As her partner, I made recommendations though her reasoning for getting that phone didn't make the most sense. Weeks later when she was telling me about him asking for more money, I then reminded her that a few weeks prior, she had told me that she had wanted to get herself a phone while in actual fact, it was Tom she wanted to get a phone for. I pointed out how betrayed that made me feel for the fact that she chose to lie to me in that moment and essentially prioritised Tom over me in that moment because now I have to deal with the harsh reality that she lied to me.  Fast forward to a few weeks later, Tom sends yet another message to her asking for money. Upon asking what she is going to do, she responded by saying that she is confliceted. That absolutely threw me off and in that moment I lost my cool. I asked how much in total she has  lent  him and she estimated $5000. The actions that follow are not my proudest moments but I harshly instructed her to let him know in that moment that she will not be sending him any money going forward and he should come up with a payment plan as to how she will repay her all her money. He then replied to say he understands and he will do so. That was the last of it untill 2 days ago; we get up to get ready for work and just as we are about to leave the house, say around 0730Hrs, I see a missed call notification from Tom and casually let her know that Tom just called. Just so that she is aware that I know. I can't imagine any other reason he would call her aside wanting to ask for money, but I didnt want to get into it that early in the morning. We left for work and throughout the day I hoped that she would tell me what Tom had called about as this has now become a sensitive topic. Nothing was said until we got back home in the evening. Still nothing was said throughout the night; we cooked, she backed  brownies  showered and still at no point was the elephant in the room addressed. In disappointment, we went to bed because I truly just did not want to probe and genuinely hoped that she would see the need in letting me into their interaction without me always having to ask.  Case 2: The same evening, after cooking and baking, she lets me know that she will be taking some of the brownies to one of her friends from the group of male friends; Mike. I met Mike about a month ago when my gf and I had gone shopping and just so happened to run into him. She introduced us, had a brief chat and went on about our day. Mike was in a car accident some time ago and as a result, his lower limbs have been compromised since so he lives with cronic pains. The brownies that my gf delivers to him every so often are meant to help alleviate that pain (THC). So when she says to me that she will be dropping some off with him, I was understanding for that reason. Further than that, I don't have any knowledge on the intricacies of their relationship. So the time is about 2230Hrs when we go to bed. Alarms set, off we go. 0400Hrs this morning the first alarms start rigning on both our phones, I turn mine off, then I turn hers off. I then see a message notification on her phone that reads ** ...anything that can help. I love you too.** ***\*3 heart emojis\****** ** That was all I got to read. This suggests that before she passed out, she had sent Mike a message to let him know that she baked him brownies and that she loves him. I got up from bed distraught, went to the bathroom and took a long shower trying to cool myself down. Soon as I got out, I went back to bed to warm my body up a bit and found her on her phone watching youtube videos. So this means she saw the message at this point. I lay next to her and kept to my phone. 5mins in she asks me if i'm ok, I proceed to let her know that no I am not ok because I just saw a disturbing message in her phone. She proceeds to say  Oh the one from Mike?  I confirm then she proceeds to say  Oh he is just a friend you know that. I only love him as a friend  I asked her if she considers that to be normal behaviour to be texting a  friend  damn near midnight to let him know that she loves him when she is laying next to me. Her rebutle was that she loves her friends and she was just letting him know. So I just said **ok** because I still did not believe what had just happened. Additionally, before addressing anything I just wanted to ask around from women I know if that was normal behaviour. She then shortly after got out of bed, showered and got ready probably the fastest I have ever seen her and left extremely early for work. You would have thought she was at least an hour late. We spent the whole day not talking which is unlike us until later in the afternoon when she sent funny video from IG like all is normal. I responded back with laughing emojis and that was it until we met back at home after work. Now we have another huge elephant in the room. Normally I am the one to bring things up that need to be addressed but today I couldn't get myself to do it because I just did not feel like being lied to. I didnt want to get hurt any further so we engaged in the most robotic small talk about work, then shortly after, I went into my home office to do some work. She then went to shower and straight to bed without saying goodnight.  I am honestly at a crossroads and have no clue yet what my next move will be. I thinks I just need to know if it is normal for friends to say I love you to each other with heart emojis and all.  Pardon my typos.",1

I got out of a fairly emotionally fulfilling relationship a couple of months ago, and I’ve been feeling empty and sad and lonely ever since.   I downloaded all the apps but I have not met anyone that interested me enough to go on a date with.   A few days ago, I’ve found someone and we decided to go on a date, only for this person to not talk to me at all the day of, I was feeling bummed so me and my friends decided to go out for drinks instead.   We went to a bar and had a few drinks, and my friend kept telling me that the guy in the table behind us was eyeing me all night long, we didn’t talk, and I didn’t think anything of it, then a couple of hours, me and my friend moved to a night club.  Surprisingly, the guy from the bar was there. We saw each other, and then his female friend came to my table and asked me if I wanted to join them. I joined them, and me and the guy started talking, he offered me a few drinks and we really hit it off. We exchanged number and then me and my friend just went home.   The next day, he asked me if I wanted to go on a date with him, I said I was busy but that we could meet the next day. He said he has a friends birthday at night, but we could meet earlier.   We went to a restaurant and again, the conversation was extremely smooth, and I was feeling a lot of attraction which I haven’t felt towards someone in such a long time.   After the restaurant he asked me if I wanted to go over to his friends place (the girl who came to me at the club) and I said why not, we had a couple of drinks then he asked me if I wanted to be his date at his friends birthday.   I was really enjoying his company and I couldn’t say no, so we went there, and again I was enjoying his company so much, and he was the perfect gentleman.  We ended up spending the night together, but the thing is, we kissed and he “took care of me” and when I wanted to return the favour, he said that I really don’t have to, and that making me feel good is already very satisfying to him.   I was a bit drunk and kind of eager to more forward, but he stopped me and said that he really likes me, and doesn’t want this to be a one time thing, so he would rather not go to the next step on our first night together, then he proceeded to “take care of me” again, after saying that I should stay frustrated for not going further.   The next morning **that** happened again.   We ended up spending 3 days in a row together, with him being such a gentleman, complementing me every time he has the chance, driving me anywhere I need to go, refusing to let me lift a finger and generally just taking really good care of me.   It’s insane but I feel like I’m falling for this man already, and I’ve only known him for like 5 days.   I don’t know if this whole thing is normal, or if I’m being love bombed, or if guys who just like to take care of their dates actually do exist.   I’ve had such bad experiences in my past relationships, so being treated this way is so foreign and new that I don’t know what to make of it.",1
ActualMuffin8722,I found out that my dad who left us 11 years ago is married now and has a daughter,104,14gokoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14gokoy/i_found_out_that_my_dad_who_left_us_11_years_ago/,55,2023-06-23 04:17:45,relationships," My dad is a mechanical engineer and works for Aramco, in saudi arabia, and only visit us in Germany in vacations, two times a year at least and stays for a month or two, but he calls from now and then to check in. He earns a lot of money and always been generous with us, both me and my brother were in private schools, he take care of all the payments with a little help from my mom. She thinks his spendings are irrational when it comes to gifts and that we’re spoiled but he disagrees. for example he bought us two ipads when it first launched, every new version of PS and always take us two days a week, free spending, to buy whatever we want, when he’s around.   However, he’s very emotionally dictant. I don’t recall having a conversation with him as a father and son, and he doesn’t even know anything about us (health wise or school wise) unless my mom told him so. He’s very serious and introverted, spends most of his time working on his laptop then get drunk in the night. whenever we talk to him we have to be very respectful which i don’t mind, but despite that he was never violent nor cruel, never even raised his voice when he’s having an argument with my mom. Though their relationship was not the best, it was very transparent that they were still together merely because of us. They’re both workaholic so it didn’t matter if someone isn’t present.   When i turned 12 my dad told us that they’re getting divorced, and that he’s gonna live in saudi and won’t be able to visit like usual. He asked me and my brother to come with him, that we’re gonna live in a very nice compound and go to an international school. We were kids and moving to another part of the map with someone we barely talk to was not very tempting. So we refused and i’ve to believe that it was a reason for him to never contact us all those years. Things changed slowly once he left, but very drastically. We had to switch to public schools, and learn to only buy what we need not what we crave from now on. My mom works in a clinic but she wasn’t that free with the money, so while it’s a  very small change  it's still a bucket of money for her especially since she’s doing all the expenses by her own. He left and completely disappeared, no calls no nothing for 11 years. He wasn’t even close to his brothers and sisters so we didn’t have a relationship with them either.   But recently one of my uncles (his brother) reached out, he apologized for being out of the picture and said that it was our father’s fault for keeping us away from the family. Turns out my dad has converted to islam, got married to a saudi woman and have a little daughter now. He gave us his number and asked us to reach out, saying that he’s a strange man but he still loves us both. My older brother wasn’t interested and thought i was being petty for even thinking about it. I understand how desperate and fool i might sound but i’ve been craving to have a father figure for so long. Nobody knows how envious i feel towards my friends when they’re being celebrated by their dads, it gets to me horribly. After all those years maybe things changed and maybe he’s willing to make things right, and i’m willing to forgive him. I’ve always respected him for giving us a safe domestic environment, maybe showing love was hard for him but he still was a good father to me, and that’s what my brother failed to acknowledge. am i really being petty for wanting to have a relationship with him?   tl;dr One of my uncles reached out and told us the news, he’s married and has a daughter. despite leaving us for so long he’s been nothing but a good father and i want to talk to him to make things right.   Edit: I’ve read every comment and i’ll certainly keep reading. You gave me a fair perspective and i thank you all for the insights. I was indeed being petty and foolish for having high hopes in a hopeless situation. I had a rush of strong emotions after hearing about him for the first time and forced myself to be optimistic. But in the end, he did abandon me and i’ve to fathom this fact and move on.",1

This didn’t seem to upset our friendship much when it happened as we’re both very chill and understanding people (it did lead to a hiccup because they knew it hurt me and that I was upset).     I thought my feelings for them would wane with time, but they haven’t. At all. In fact, they’ve deepened. Everything feels so right with them, and I feel so at home with them. We even finish each others’ sentences. It felt so much that we were a perfect fit.     My problem is that my delusional ass keeps thinking that they might have feelings for me but just don’t know it, as they often experience alexithymia and have trouble understanding and articulating their feelings (according to them). But I know this probably isn’t true, and even if there’s a chance it is, I’m only breaking my heart more by keeping up hope in the case that it isn’t.    I don’t know what to do. We’re only becoming closer and closer friends, and it’s very painful to continue to have these feelings when they don’t reciprocate. I’ve been very respectful of boundaries and haven’t asked about it since I confessed and we talked about it, months ago. Any advice would be helpful.",1

I was about 14 years old when I confessed to my mother I was gay. She didn’t like that (as I was living in a Estern European country) so she took me to different priests and psychologists.  This was a very hard period of my life as I was practically abused both physically and emotionally by my parents, after she had told my dad.   Fast forward, when I was 16 I met this girl (she was also 16) that I had no interest in, through some of my parent’s family friends. She is the daughter of one of my dad’s friends. We were playing monopoly when I decided to donate her all the money and let her win out of being a gentleman as my mum taught me since I was a little child.   Two months later, she decided to message me because she liked me very much. It was the Pandemic so we couldn’t go for a date, however we spoke for days though messages after I ‘confessed’ I like her back, even though I was mostly pressured by my mum who was extremly happy that I might get a girlfriend given the fact she has tried to convert me to heterosexuality for some years.  I told the girl I was bisexual, she had no problem with that and we got along very very very well after our first in person date. Another two months pass and we tried to have sex, keep in mind we were both virgins.   It was a beautiful night, got some grass and tried to have sex as I really thought I am truly bisexual now and I tried to convince me of this. Turns out I couldn’t get an erection and after trying so for 30 minutes I told her ‘Maybe I am just gay and I don’t like girls. I am really confused now, to be fair’. She being the nicest person I know said that is ok and we can take a break.  The day after, I realised how stupid I am and I realised I had performance issues due to extremly hight anxiety or because of the weed. Called her back crying for her to return and she said that is fine we can get back together. Another 2 months pass, we had sex several times and I realised that I am gay and that I want to live my life truly and not in a lie. This was one of the best feelings in the world. This broke her heart but we decided to remain best friends.  For another month or so, we were friends with benefits somehow and did the deed quite often, however we stopped because this was not ok for neither of us. I will tell you that she was the ONLY girl I could get a boner because. No other girl was attractive to me, and I really loved her.   Four months pass, I didn’t tell my mother anything as almost everynight we were sleeping over to another. I got a boyfriend and invited him over as my mum was away in another country. On night she called me and she caught me with him as I was shaking and missclicked the mute button when I told him to get out. My mum came back as fast as she could and the abuse has began again.   Several months passed and my mother calmed down. Me and my girl friend were suppose to move to in the same time in different countries but we were so close we cried for weeks before. A month before leaving we started doing the deed again but as friends with benefits and in the last night I confessed again that I really really love her and I want to be in relationship with her. She agreed as she was crazy over me. One year apart having a long distance relationship I moved to her. Keep in mind I told her I’m queer and I don’t want to label myself. I still listen to artists ‘for gays’ like Beyonce and Ariana Grande but I wouldn’t let this define me.   Months passed now I’m 19 she is 18 and I started to have fantasies about men. One night while she was out of town I hopped on grindr and sucked someone in the backseat of his car. I knew this was wrong and I regret cheating on her but I was so so curious and couldn’t help myself. Sometimes I masturbate to gay porn while she is away but we still have sex every now and then I really enjoy it sometimes. I always joke around saying that I like pretty boys but she does the same and we laugh it off.   I know I am a shit person and I know I should break up with her but I don’t think she can take it no more. I really love her but sometimes I miss the touch of a man, the smell of cologne and some muscles. I still don’t label myself and I’m trying to keep my adventure secret.  TLDR: I’ve said yes to one girl and ven thoug I was gay and now I love her but now I have fantasied about men even though I thought I was bisexual",1

We were friends before that for around 4-5 months. At the beginning of our relationship, he put in so much effort; he wanted to hang out every day, he would reach out early. He planned our dates, he texted me almost every day to check in with me, he said “I love you” first, and he made me feel really loved and cared for. After the 6 month mark, I kind of felt this fading away. He asks me what days I wanted to hang out in the week and on a good week it usually pans out that we hang out on 2 weekday evenings. We have the same friend group and we go out with them on the weekend nights (Friday and Saturday), and he usually tells me that he is too hungover or tired to hang out during the days on the weekend. Recently, we’ve only spent one evening alone together in the whole week because he has been flaking on other days, saying that he didn’t sleep well and will go to bed early, or that he has to go to the gym (which he invited me to come but I don’t because I go to a different gym and I’m not going to pay $30 for a guest pass).  Yesterday he told me that he is going to the gym on Monday-Thursday, to which I responded that he can come over afterwards, and he was down. But he texts me last minute today that he is tired and will go home after the gym.   When we do hang out though , he is so loving and kisses me and tells me how much he loves me and it confuses me.  I am tired of looking forward to being with him and being let down. I have been waiting to spend time with him the whole day, I cleaned my apartment, I planned out dinner and what show we would watch and he flakes on me. This is not the first time, it’s become rather usual now. I don’t know whether to take it personally but I keep questioning why he doesn’t want to see me as much as I want to see him. Spending time with him is the highlight of my day, but it feels like this relationship is not his first priority and it’s the first thing that goes out the door for him. If he’s so tired, how come he can go to the gym for 3 hours? He’s so tired that after that he can’t just sit and watch a TV show with me for an hour and go to bed? I’m tired of feeling rejected every time he cancels on me. Should I talk to him about it or is it not worth it? I want him to spend time with me because he WANTS to spend time with me, not because I am forcing him to. Is this just a fundamental incompatibility?   TLDR: My boyfriend has stopped making an effort to spend quality time with me 7 months in and it feels like he puts the gym first. Can this be fixed my talking to him or is it just a fundamental incompatibility?",1

We had both time off work so we quickly went to spending time together 24/7. He practically moved in with me, only visiting his place for fresh clothes. We professed our feelings for each other, met each other’s friends and families, and talked about the future. He was a dream come true for me. Everything was so easy, natural, fun, like nothing I’ve experienced before. Our core values lined up perfectly. There was intellectual, emotional, and sexual attraction. It was mutual and he was forward and clear about how he’s feeling, which felt very refreshing and soothing for me. We were an inseparable duo.  And now, for the last month or so, he’s been a bit more distant and hasn’t talked about the future as much. He’s spent a lot of time with his hobby, fishing, which I thought was nothing weird because it’s spring time and he’s really passionate about that hobby. However, we’ve spent all other time together like before. We’ve kissed, hugged, had fun. We’ve made plans together. This week, we visited his parents, had sex and booked an activity for June. I had a weird feeling of distance however, which I brought up casually, thinking it had something to do with work stress or something. He told me he had been feeling the same. We agreed to discuss it with good time, face-to-face that night.  That night, last Thursday, he told me he wasn’t 100 % committed anymore. He told me his feelings have died down. He swore he never lied to me about what he felt before but after the initial crush faded, stronger feelings didn’t emerge. I thought we were on the same wavelength as I had developed strong feelings and kind of jumped into the conclusion that I’ll spend the rest of my life with him. I thought what he had told me earlier, held true. He couldn’t pinpoint when he had started to lose his feelings for me. He apologized for not telling me earlier. He swore there were no third parties involved, and I believe him. I asked him if it was even realistic to expect deep love at 5 months; after I asked, he told me he had that with his ex (they were together for 3-4 years and had trust issues from the beginning, eventually killing the relationship. He ended it and is still glad he did it.)  I’m completely at a loss. I was ready to spend my life with him. I felt like I had found my perfect match, a best friend in a romantic companion, a once-in-a-lifetime love. I got along amazingly with his friends & family and they were so supportive of us. I could never have guessed THIS was his reason for becoming distant. When he told me his feelings had waned, I felt like I was talking to a whole another person than who I’d come to know. I was devastated, surprised, shocked. I didn’t see this coming and neither did anyone close to us.  How do I ever get over this? How do I trust anyone’s feelings ever again? Of course he tells me there’s nothing wrong with me and it’s not my fault. He was quite fine on Thursday, crying a bit, but yesterday when we texted he told me he was feeling a lot worse. I was ready to go the distance and I don’t think I will ever find anyone so compatible with me. I’ve been hopeless and trying to find where we went wrong. Did we get too intense too quickly? But it felt like the most natural thing in the world. He has a very impatient temper, he wants to achieve his life goals ASAP, which may contribute to this but I was ready to go forward in life with him. He told me it’s better this breakup happened now, not when have a house and 2 kids. It breaks my heart thinking he wouldn’t see a future with me.   I was so shocked I couldn’t really form a sentence when he initially told me, so we talked on the phone and texted later and now I thought I’d ask him to meet me for a final chat tomorrow night.   Please help me. Right now I feel like I will never get over this. It would help me if I could explain this to myself in an easier way (”he’s just too immature to commit”, ”he’s been mean to me anyway”) but no. I’ll have to accept he didn’t develop love for me like I did for him. I would have done anything to have mutual love. How do I ever get over this?  TL;DR: I think I found the love of my life. It got serious fast. He professed his feelings for me. After 5 months, he tells me his feelings have waned. I love him. I don’t think I’ll ever get over it.",1

I met my best friend a few years before I met my now wife. My best friend and I flirted with the idea of dating but never took that step because we didn’t want to ruin our friendship. We each dated other people, and eventually I got married. I’ve been married a few years now and my job often takes me away from the home I share with my wife for months at a time.   On my way back from one such months long trip, I stayed at my best friends house for a few days to break up the long driving. We spent platonic time together and we went on dates in everything but name. Everything we did felt like it had this air of both of us holding something back.   When it came time for me to leave and drive back to my own home, I felt the most powerful feeling of regret at leaving that I have ever felt. I normally feel sad when I have to leave my wife, but leaving my best friend made me feel actual despair.   During the 15 hour drive I have now come to the realization that I have loved my best friend the entire time I have been with my wife, and that isn’t fair to anyone.  I still love my wife, but not the same way that I love my best friend. I don’t even necessarily want to be with my best friend romantically, I just want to be in her life more than I currently am. I want to help make her dreams come true in a way that I don’t feel for my wife.    My wife has done nothing wrong, and that makes it even harder. If feels wrong to keep this bottled up inside but it would devastate my wife to find out that I feel this way.   I feel like I need to tell my best friend and my wife the truth of the situation, but it isn’t fair to either of them. I’m just not sure what to do other than keep my feelings buried inside, but it doesn’t feel fair to either of the most important people in my life. I just need advice.   TLDR: Been in love with my best friend since before I met my wife. Just realized it.",1
Trick-Ad9660,My (38F) boyfriend and future fiancé (44M) won’t come visit my family with me. Even during a crisis.,565,13xjvc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13xjvc0/my_38f_boyfriend_and_future_fiancé_44m_wont_come/,242,2023-06-01 15:02:30,relationships,"TLDR: I always come spend time with his family no matter what - even if it’s uncomfortable or they treat me badly. He almost never comes with me despite my family pretty much worshipping him and me needing a bit more emotional support from him. We just had a death in the family and he’s refusing visit with me because he “doesn’t like the vibes”. I’ve told him I’m seriously doubting his commitment to me.    My Uncle just passed away under tragic circumstances. He’s refusing to come with me and saying he isn’t obliged to visit my family with me ever at all. We’ve been together 7 years and he says he wants us to get married and have children. He gets on very well with my family, they adore him. They even treat me better when he’s around.  He is incredibly self centred when it comes to supporting me or visiting them. Members of my family keep asking me why I’m always there alone and my mother has started to feel disrespected that he wouldn’t come visit with me despite him being in town. I have to keep making excuses for him. Not only am I becoming embarrassed I’m starting to doubt his sincerity towards me and our relationship.   I’ll preface this by saying I’ve been to visit his family many many many times. There has been some occasions where a certain (extremely mentally ill) member of his family had been verbally abusive towards me, he didn’t have my back in these situations that were clearly not my fault. Although I appreciate and respect them, his family has caused me a notable amount of upset but A couple of times he’s admitted it was him causing conflict. For example: coming home drunk and acting abusive while I tried to sober him up and calm Him down. He then blamed me it for causing trouble with his mother. He apologised and admitted fault MUCH later on but it caused an insane amount of trouble. He seems to revert to acting like a child around his family and Ive told him I find it distressing and uncomfortable to be around. Despite things like this I still always come, always offer support and friendship because I was under the impression that these people are my future family also and I’m duty bound to treat them with kindness and respect.   I’d bought us a car because he was complaining he didn’t get to see his family enough. One day he awoke me to say his mother had taken ill and was in a coma. I awoke immediately- packed our bags. I booked hotels and transport. She died so helped his family arrange the funeral, even helped out buying everyone clothes to attend the funeral in. It cost me well over £1000 and I was there with him every step of the way.   Now I’ve just found out about the death of my uncle. He asked me to buy him another car. I said this time I will loan you the money but I’m return I’ll need you to take me to my family so I can help make arrangements. He said fine I’ll drop you off then leave. I said no please come with me for the day (I have many siblings and I’d like him to not only support me but also get some time in with my family as we’re supposed to be getting engaged. He said no. He can’t be bothered. I’m literally asking him to just be by my side through this - he shouted at me that it’s a waste of his time and he’d rather be doing something fun.   I have no words. I told him I’m saying to think about us splitting up over his selfishness and disrespect. I love him and want us to be together but I’m turning 39 this year. I don’t have time to plead with him to do the bare minimum. It seems like everything’s perfect but only as long as he always gets his own way and never has to make any effort. I honestly don’t understand why he’s behaving this way and I’m deeply upset. I’m going through a deep feeling of grief right now and thinking I’m going to have to leave the man I’m supposed to be marrying is starting to become an unbearable weight upon me. I don’t know what to do.  EDIT: I’ve been engaged before when I was young and it was unpleasant. He wanted to propose but I insisted that he didn’t until we are going to be setting a date and planning the wedding.   Also someone picked up on the fact I have an abusive family. He didn’t understand how hard the situation is for me (he should’ve been right there anyway of course). But he’s seen the abusive messages I get from family members and stepped in to ask them what do they think they are doing? It’s literally the first time anyone’s stuck up for me against them but doesn’t excuse the negligence and immaturity.",1

I hate the last things we said to each other.   When I first heard your voice, it did something to me. You walked by and said  whats up yall?  And i knew that voice. I looked up at you and i just couldn't look away. This feeling came over me that i had never felt before. It was like i had already loved you before and loved you forever.   I never pay attention to men, or  check them out  but when I saw your face and looked into your eyes, it was the most amazing feeling I have ever experienced in my life. You're just the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. I use to get so freaking excited when we would see each other. The eye contact. I don't even know how to put into words what I feel when we make eye contact. It's the most blissful and comforting feeling I've ever had in my life.   Your face is burned into my brain. I can't forget you. I remember every interaction we had, every thing you've ever said to me, and every time you looked at me. Oh god, I love the way you would look at me. It was different.  You weren't looking at my body in a lustful way, you were looking at my soul through my eyes.   I was totally, madly, passionately in love with you.  You have no idea. I thought about you constantly,  fantasized about you (you're seriously the sexiest thing I've ever seen), and constantly worried about you, wondering if you were lonely or happy.    And then reality sunk in. I was married and I'm  not a cheater. So, I started avoiding you. And that's when everything started happening. I saw you everywhere all the time. I would have all this weird shit start happening to me (it all revolved around you). I thought the universe was playing some sort of sick joke on me. Why would this person come into my life, and make me  experience the most love I've ever felt in my life just to not be able to be with them?   We started interacting more bc of the kiddos, and became friends. I was so happy to have you in my life, even if it was just as a friend. I was so smitten with you, that I told my closest friends and my family about you. I know, it sounds really weird and pathetic, but i just had to tell someone.  I saw you everywhere, all the time. I would have these really weird things happen to me, and the signs, o god the signs literally drove me insane. Ive never told anyone about the signs.  I let people get in my head. The things they were telling me were things that never even  occurred to me. I freaked out. I was so scared. I had a lot going on in my personal life at the time, (in school for the surgical program and living with a spouse during separation/divorce), I thought maybe the things they were saying were true.   I know I said a couple of things about you. I guess it got back to you somehow, im not exactly sure of how because I only talked to 2 people about you in our neighborhood, one of them I know for sure wouldn't betray me, the other, i thought was my friend, but not so much looking back.   I'm not trying to place the blame on others, I know I'm in the wrong. It's my fault and I'm so, so sorry. I wish I could talk to you and make it right,  but i know that will never happen. Please know im so sincerely sorry and this is my biggest regret in life.   Now, whenever I see you around town, and you see me, your facial expression says it all. You hate me. You really hate me, and thats ok. Those are your feelings, but what really kills me is how you must feel on the inside because it's projecting out on your face. I hate so much for you to feel any anger, hate, or anything negative. I can see it on your face, and I caused it. I hate that this happened. I really am so sorry. I wish I could make it right for you.   Please don't hate me, not because of me not wanting you to feel this way about me, but because I hate seeing anguish on your face. I don't want you to ever feel anything bad.   I really want the best for you, to be happy, and at peace. I love you R, and I know I'm going to love you forever. May you find the peace and tranquility that I oh so desire for you.   I love you. Be happy please 💗",1

I got a promotion and we decided she would work reduced hours so I could focus on work, while both at the same time have a more relaxed lifestyle.  I show love by doing things, which is not what she needs. I could be better with touch and words, which she wants to receive.  Me, on the other hand, need my alone time, something I've tried to explain in every way I can think of. I am working my ass off, both at home and at work. The idea was that with reduced hours, she could maintain the home, something that never happens. Alone time is never offered, and when I ask for it she always gets upset.  Eventually I get so irritable, she fixes baby-sitting with her parents. (My parents cant). However, even if she had a whole week without work, when the weekend comes, it will still be a mess. I do want to surprice her, so I spend my alone time cleaning the house. Having sacrificed my alone time to do something for her doesn't really bring me in the mood to show my love in her love language.  After a small argument a few weeks ago we started talking about love language. I asked her what love language she used and how she showed her love to me, to which she answered that she didn't know. I didn't make a big deal about it, but I let her think about it for a few days and then asked again, and she still didn't know. --- **tl;dr**: Can a wife actually love a husband, when she has no examples of how she shows purported love for said husband? I can't imagine living with a person I love and not know what I do out of love for that person, which leads me to believe that perhaps she doesn't.",1

(Also english is not my first language, so sorry for the mistakes)  Me (female, 25) and my bestfriend (female, 25) know each other since we were kids, we are literally are like sisters and I would trust her with my life.  Only one tiny little problem: I'm madly in love with her ex-boyfriend (male, 27) and I know he reciprocates, but I have no clue on what to do about it.  Now, the story starts a few years ago, when she fell in love with this guy. He was very cold, also a bit rude and I really didn't like him very much, but she went after him and they started dating. Me and him weren't in the best of relationships because I initially thought he was taking advantage of her and that she was being naive but, after a while, he warmed up to me and I started to understand that she was right all along.   I didn't fall for him immediatly - it was a slow realization. We started getting along, and became very close 'cause of all the time we three spent together. During a very bad moment of my life he was very sweet and understanding (my mom died and he was the only one to really get me, because he lost his father too).   After a while I realized i fell for him. I felt disgusted at myself, because I knew my bestfriend loved him deeply and he also liked her (how could he not, she is a sweetheart!). So I tried to get over him, but nothing seemed to work.   At last I took the chance to make a clean cut and decided to go abroad for university, thinking that it was for the best for everyone, myself first. I didn't cut ties with her - she was still one of the most important people of my life - but never brought him up in our conversations if she didn't. He also wrote me a few times, checking if I was fine, but I dicided to not engage in conversations, finding excuses on the late replies and after a while we lost contact.  I was away for three years; had study to focus on, new friendships and also a few relationships. I only saw him a couple of times when I came home for holidays and overall managed not to think about him. But the times I met him it was always hard to keep me distanced.  But now comes the crazy part... I finished my studies and came back home. When I met with my bestfriend, I found out they broke up about six months ago. She didn't tell me because last year we heard each other less, and said she didn't want to upset me: they broke up because of me. He confessed to her that he realized he was in love with me, and that he didn't really know 'till I disappeared from his life (only hearing of me from her, and meeting me once a year). He said to her that he really liked her and cared for her and couldn't find the courage to tell her the truth, because he felt bad and didn't want to break her heart or ruin our friendship (mine and hers). But they were both suffering from the whole situation and he couldn't keep misleading them both.  She was obviously very hurt, but said that she appreciated his sincerity and that now she is fine. They still talk to each other and apparently stayed friends (I don't know to what level).  I met him twice since I came back - once at a party and once we met accidentally and stopped for a coffee and a chat. He has no clue that I know why they broke up, but I surely know I like him back and that the way he's so sweet to me doesn't help at all! I feel so stupid and confused - how is it possibile that years without seeing him did so little?  My bestfriend doesn't know I like him and that I crushed on him when they were together, but now everything feels so wrong!  I don't really know what to do, and I feel that whatever I choose to do I could lose one of them.",1

You know secrets about me that nobody knows, and you are the only one who has the complete collection. You have paid witness to, as well as shared the most deeply emotional tears pulled from my soul.   I was beside you the moment your worst second in life occurred, as you were with mine. Both of us the only one present at the deaths of former selves. In these we both realized the feeling of being powerless in its rawest form… as well as love.   You have given me gifts without pricetags, and that can only be created by love, not replicated in effort.   The quiet in the storm is the greatest of all, forever unsurpassed. It was the one thing that I thought lost with Nana… the thing that saved me so many times.   The smile I got from you in those months I lost it completely. The smile that kept me alive for certain. The smile that held on when all others were gone.   Finally my manhood. My sexual desire. My feeling I had lost completely, and something I never knew took so much from my soul.   Forever thankful, I will carry these gifts for life, and never lose them again. Holding as well an appreciation for the loss of the originals, as yours were meant to replace them.  Love is what we created as two individuals, and it grew into something beyond anything I ever dreamed possible. The elements I recognize now gathered together, I once thought fiction.   Love at first sight, or atleast first kiss. Love that seems unconditional and is. Love that grows every single day. Love that makes you question every love from before, and kills any true chance of any to come. Love that physically effects not just on occasion but with each and every moment.   I finally see someone in detail unimagined before. I see this detail in layers upon layers, on top of forms. Most of all I see you, and see your outward beauty as a result of the whole. It’s an appreciation thats depth of which descriptive words could be used on ad nauseam to attempt to do justice, but still lack suffice.   The attraction we share I feel is unlike any I’ve known before. Not only it’s initial intensity, but it’s steady growth to what it is now. It’s mutual feeling seems to make it charge with energy. The result of it all being when my body and yours connect. It’s not an explosion as much as a rush that comes from the exchange of something that can not be defined in nature.   I never have fought for someone so hard, felt failure so deeply, and never have I been so certain that the end is worth whatever pain the way will bring. Somehow gleaning a lesson from each failure. It’s like I see a bigger picture, and see opportunity in struggle clear as day. A struggle worth enduring with pride. Maybe even a wish for more.   I truly believe I know your soul, and I believe it’s also mine. Or I suppose ours. Split in two at one point, forever seeking itself. You’re the emotion to my logic, and the perfect balance to a perfect whole. No need for a mate, or a twin. When you find yourself instead.  Our future spreads out before us, and in it I know we are as one. I see it all with a certainty that doesn’t leave me with a doubt a question. I see children, I see a home, and I see a life that we can look back on, and truly behold.  We found eachother again, and I know we will next time.   More than yesterday, less than tomorrow.",1

I saw myself getting married to him and starting a family just like we planned. Since the day he left I tried everything to get over him, but nothing seems to work. He’s still the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about at night. Recently I found out from a mutual friend that he’s back in town, I don’t know if he’s only back for some time or if he’s back permanently. I have found myself thinking about him more and thinking if he still has feelings for me too or if they have vanished.

Of course I didn’t want to see him crying all day, but it would’ve been nice to get a text once in a while hearing that he still missed me or thought about me just like I did. I keep trying to convince myself to get over it, because if he still had feelings for me he would’ve reached out already or something. I keep fighting myself over this and I just want it to be over. I just want him to tell me if he still loves me or not so that I can finally get some peace of mind even if it hurts me.",1

My husband is a good father and a good partner. We've been together for nearly 5 years. I've always loved my husband and went out of my way to do special things for him because I wanted to. Now, while I still do those things to make him feel loved and appreciated, I find them more of a chore than something I want to do. 9/10 I don't feel much of anything towards him. Not love. Not hate. Not anger. Not sadness. Not anything. I don't know why. I'm extremely emotionally distant from my husband and I've tried to reignite something in every way I can think of. I'm not sure what else to do, but I'm really starting to fear we will end up divorcing due to my inability to return feelings he has.It's even at a point where if he did something horrible in our relationship like cheating on me, I don't think I'd blink an eye about it. He's still my best friend and I care about him a lot in that way. I'm really having a hard time connecting with him emotionally anymore though. No event has lead to this disconnect either. Things have been good. Any advice of any kind would be greatly appreciated as I want to make our marriage work, I'm just at a loss when it comes to my own lack of emotions.  ^^^^this lack of feeling has been for nearly 6 months.  Edit:: Since I've been getting a lot of DM's and a couple comments about communicating with my husband. He is fully aware of the situation and even knows I have posted this, outsourcing for ideas. We have had many clear and rational conversations about this and both want to see change. Unfortunately due to the cost of health care where I live and myself being in school right now, between the cost of tuition and raising our family, we do not presently have the extra funds for therapy/couples counseling.  Update:: My husband and I have both read through these comments and genuinely appreciate the majority of them. Since therapy is difficult for us right now (not just for money but also time). We have decided to meet with my doctor later today. We are going together to discuss if this is potentially post partum and to get some blood tests done to see if I have any imbalances.  We have also by recommendation decided to take our daughter to my parents house for a few days so we have some time after our meeting with my doctor to sort some things out about our next steps.  For those of you who were wondering. Our daughter is 2 years old. And for those who think this is myself trying to be single, you could not be more wrong. I have always known and still know my husband is the one for me. We've gone through roommate spells and such before, this is just different and more extreme than anything we've had before. I do not recognize anything that's lead to this and I know I don't want anyone else. My husband is my person and I am his. This is simply a difficulty right now in our marriage. If not dealt with though it would be unfair for me to keep him in this marriage.  I will update with what the doctor says and how the next few days go.",1

To clarify: my granddaughter was compromised. She had already a condition that rendered it impossible for her to get her shots. Which I'd why my daughter was so carefull and didn't expose her baby to more than park air and took heavy precautions of they had to go to closed spaces with her.    This is not about his daughter but his niece.  I have 2 kids. My daughters daughter passed due to my sons stupidity.  My son Andrew marries Alexis 8 years ago. I am by no mean a Monster in law. Never have been. But Alexis is a nightmare. She is anti science pro Facebook science,  she is awefully entiteled and is sinking all their savings in some MLM scheme. And as such... they decided not to vaccinate their kids. They have a son (m10) and a daughter (f6).  A month ago my daughter, Jenny, came over with her baby to pick up some of her old things. She decided to stay for coffee and cake.  Andrew and Alexis moved right across from us after the lock down lifted. My husband and I assume, it's because they were planing on using us a free childcare.  Anyway, as Jenny was over Alexis rung the doorbell. Before I could even say hello, her kids came spilling in. They are nice kids. Somewhat bratty but they do have a heart of gold. I love them so much. But because od them not being vaccinated, I don't like having them around the same time as babies. I tried to keep things calm but the kids had run upstairs to where Jenny's baby was sleeping and were cuddling with her. I managed to get them to come down. But they had bee with the baby for a few minutes.   Fast forward a few days. Jenny calls me in tears telling me her and her fiance are in the hospital because their baby had a high fever ans couldn't breathe properly.  My husband and I hurried there. Then we spent the most excruciating 17 hours in the hospital that sadly ended with my granddaughter passing away. She had apparently caught whooping cough and her little lungs couldn't handle it. My daughter is absolutely destroyed.  I had a stinging suspicion and called my son. I asked him if his kids had been sick. He said that they had a nasty cough and a little fever but that they had managed.  I don't know what happened. I lost it. I just started breathing heavy and crying hard and couldn't say much more but to say that his niece died because of him.  He had been calling me and his sister. And we haven't picked up. He has come over multiple times and I have not opened.  I tried to calm down and tell myself, that it's probabe that she caught it from someone else. Only that my daughter hadn't taken out granddaughter to places with kids for almost a month. Maybe at a super marked or in a walk. But my husband pointed out that it was likelier she caught it trough close contact. And it is possible to catch it outside. But not as likley.  I feel so mad... so angry. I don't know what to do. I live my other grand kids. And I feel like they are gonna suffer with them as parents.  How to we go forward? Jennybis never gonna forgive Andrew. And I don't know if I can.   Tldr: my son didn't vaccinate his kids. They gave my daughters daughter whooping cough. My granddaughter died as a direct result of this. I don't know how to proceed in life.",1
sprinkledonuts8220,"Serious boyfriend [29/M] wants us to move away from a job I love [28/F] in favor of his career prospects, how do we reconcile this?",0,14hxhap,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14hxhap/serious_boyfriend_29m_wants_us_to_move_away_from/,15,2023-06-24 16:41:26,relationships,"(Boyfriend and I been together almost 4 years)  I’m currently working for a company that I love. It’s not a perfect place (in the sense that NO place is) but it’s fantastic and I fit in so well with the company culture, a lot of the people there, and there’s a lot of growth opportunities. I’m actually not in the job I plan to have in the longer term, I’m currently in grad school for my actual career path, but part of why I took a job with this company a few years ago is that they also offer jobs in my field and I hope to stay there once I graduate, except in a different position. I’ve talked with many people in the field at my job and most of them love their jobs there too. I genuinely love going into work there every day, the only thing I could wish was different would be maybe getting home a few minutes earlier or coming in slightly later lol.  My (serious) boyfriend (who says he plans to propose within the next year or so) found an INCREDIBLE job opportunity in his field in a city a bit further away from where we are now. I don’t want to go into detail but take my word it’d be an amazing, long-term opportunity for him and I want him to go for it. Right now my commute to work is like 45 minutes but I’ve been hoping for a shorter commute by the time we’d try for kids (maybe like 5ish years from now), so I always said I hoped to move a little closer to where my job is, but I don’t mind being like 20-30 mins away if we’re in an area that works better for him. However if we move to be closer to where this opportunity would be, the closest I’d feasibly be is like 1 hour from my current job, which I’d be ok with doing for a few months initially but not in the long term. Aside from this we both love the area we’re looking into, we think we’d have a good social life and fun things to do there (when we’d have the time for it… LOL) and they have fantastic schools too which is hard to find in our overall area (like if I drew a big 3 hour drive diameter circle, maybe 10% of the areas in that whole circle have good middle and high schools… it’s sad. For context, where we currently live is in the 90% and careers aside we don’t plan to stay here when we have kids)  What has been keeping me on the fence is that I’d likely have to ultimately find a new company to work for if we move there. I looked into local companies in the field I’d be going into, a few seem good but few seem willing to take “new grads” and also they have different vibes (a lot of them are smaller, there is one larger one that is supposedly good but it seems a little more “strict” and has some religious undertones from its history that I’m not thrilled about). So I fear I’ll either struggle to get a job altogether, or I’ll get one in a place I may not be as happy with, when I know I love where I am now. Or maybe I’ll stay with my current company for a while, but risk burning out from the commute and have limited time and energy for a social life (never mind that we’d be further from most of our current friends too, making it harder to see them and I’d hope to make a few new ones in the new area) so in that case maybe I’d still have my job I love but feel lonely and isolated outside of work.  I asked my boyfriend his rationale, he says his career ultimately should take presedence as he earns/will likely continue to earn significantly more money than me (true) and work longer hours than me (also true, even as of now he usually comes home later than me and that will likely continue to typically be the case). Otherwise he is fully supportive of me having a career, as long as it doesn’t come at the expense of his own. I’m so torn because this opportunity would basically change his life and really springboard his career, and I otherwise really like the new area. And I do want to marry him and ultimately, I’d pick being with him over working for this company, but I don’t want to have to make that decision… Unless I find a job I love just about as much, but that’s in no way guaranteed.  TL;DR: Boyfriend (who plans to propose soon) wants to move for an amazing career opportunity on his end, to be in an area we both really like and can see ourselves settling down in, but it may lead to me giving up my job that I love and possibly not finding as good of an opportunity on my end :( How do we reconcile this so we can feel confident it can work for both our careers before we take the plunge of moving - and of getting engaged??",1

I have thought about if I still am in love with him, but I really do not feel anything for him. “Why don’t you just break up with him?” It’s very hard. I went through high school with him by my side as a partner and a best friend. Looking back at our relationship, we made memories and promises. But, I don’t remember the last time he has complimented me, asked me to hangout, paid for anything (which he has never done, I end up paying one way or another), or taken time for me. We both love to play video games but when I seriously need him, sometimes he just neglects me. I suffer with depression and anxiety but made a recovery a few years ago. I still get breakdowns but now he has completely given up on me. All he can say is “I’m sorry” and hope things can be done with because I always forgive him. There has been times where he’s dropped the most gut wrenching comment towards me in front if his friends. When I confront him, he just says I can’t take jokes. We also have been arguing on and off for the past few months and it’s taken a toll on both of us. I’ve become more argumentative and even a bit of a hypocrite. I will admit that we both have also said things that I don’t think anyone should experience or have to hear in their life. I feel stuck. I’ve tried to sit down and talk to him but it ends up getting avoided or turned into an argument.",1

My uncle, and a few of his friends, thought it would be a great idea to bring me to one of those karaoke bars (for those who don't know, they pay women to come drink and sing songs with you for a few hours) as a birthday gift for turning 20. It was great! Had a wonderful experience and I made a few friends and became closer with my uncle as well as his friends, who have been very nice to me. Now, I know what most people will say.  It's her job to be intimate with you and make you feel happy  or  she's just doing it because you paid her . I get it. It's probably true. But my dumbass self falls in love like a bullet train. Ever since my ex, I haven't felt anything close to having someone there to just listen or make you feel wanted. I understand that she wouldn't have cuddled up to me or hugged me or kissed me on the cheek if I didn't pay for her to come see me that night. But is it normal for a girl to talk that long with someone after? Especially someone in that field of work. It's been a month and although its fallen off a bit, we've facetimed a couple times and had long conversations over text as well as telling each other about our personal lives to get to know each other better. We've also flirted back and forth on multiple occasions, making each other laugh and have talked about what happened in our past as well as updating each other with what we do everyday. I don't think that's something you do with everyone.  I really like this girl. Though there is a bit of an age gap, (6 years) I feel like I can be in a relationship with this girl, and I can accept the field of work that she's in. But, if I do not see her this week, I may never see her again. I go back home to the US in 2 weeks, and I won't be in the same city as her after this Friday.   At this point, I don't know if it's worth giving it a shot to ask her out, especially because I don't know if she feels the same way. I don't even know if she'll be okay with doing a long distance relationship even if she does end up saying yes to me. My family knows about this girl and they've all said to not fall in love with her and I've tried to tell myself that I'm not but I am. And I just have a feeling that when she does reject me, it'll hurt pretty bad.  Is it worth asking this girl out? How do I stop myself from falling in love so easily? Please let me know your thoughts, I will accept any advice on what I should do. Thanks :)",1

We would hang out literally everyday for 5-6h for those 2 years. And I was their only friend all that time . As an extroverted person I always felt sense of fullfilment when I took thus person out with me and tried to meet them w other people. We were really close they even had keys to my apartment.   It all went downhill last summer when this person got involved with drugs, alcohol and generally bad people. I was always there for them but they lied several times they were sober and I openly talked how lying hurt me more than they actually doing bad stuff.  In september last year that person got in relationship. From being their #1 I fell to the last place. We were hanging out once a week and that change in less then a month. Everytime I asked that person about it they said nothing has changed and I was attention seeking. The most hurtful comment they made is that they wouldn’t care if I kill myself. They gaslighted me for half a year and I actually thought I was going insane. After my mental breakdown I decided to not text this person to see if they’re going to send message first. They never did for a month. After that I saw this person in a club, got into a fight w them and told them everything I could through tears.  6 months later this person texted me that they want to talk about everything and I want to tell them what hurt me and get some kind of closure (thinking about someone every other day for 6 months is mentally draining). I don’t feel much anger towards them now but I don’t know if I should talk to them or not.  Also I realized I was in love with them 6 months before everything. They gave me active signs of affection and even wanted to have something with me even if they’re “straight”.",1

Longtime lurker, first-time poster here. I've found myself in a bit of a bind, and I could use some advice from those who have walked this path before.   A few months ago, I asked a woman to accompany me to a concert. She declined, but that didn't stop us from striking up some truly wonderful conversations. We clicked instantly. The only issue was the distance between us - we live far apart and between my work and studies, and her commitments, we've only been able to meet once in person.  This woman is extraordinary. She has two daughters, and she's experienced more hardship than most. Her first husband was abusive, and after finally getting out of that situation, her second husband took his own life while she was in the hospital. She's beaten cancer not once, but twice. Despite these adversities, she remains a beacon of love and kindness, taking care of her kids and even volunteering at a local children's home.   Recently, she was diagnosed with cancer for the third time. I can't begin to imagine the fear and pain she must be going through. Since the diagnosis, she's pulled away. She's stopped engaging in our conversations, and has told me that she can't be with me anymore because she doesn't want to hurt me.   I'm at a loss. My first instinct is to be there for her, to offer comfort and support in any way I can, but she's pushing me away. I understand where she's coming from. She's trying to protect me from the pain and uncertainty of her situation. But it hurts to be pushed away, especially when all I want to do is help.  So here I am, asking you, /r/love, for your advice. How do I navigate this situation? How can I be there for her without overstepping her boundaries? How can I cope with the pain of being pushed away by someone I care deeply for?   Thanks in advance for your advice and support. It truly means the world to me.",1

(who we'll call Ellie)  I've been in love with Ellie pretty much since we first met five years ago, but about a week ago they started dating my best friend. (who we'll call Derek) The four of us also live together, which really puts the cherry on the cake. I thought that when I started dating Max that my feelings for Ellie might deteriorate and that I'd be able to forget them and move on with a happy relationship with Max. Max and I are very happy together, we're constructive, communicate well, and overall are a great couple.   Max knows that I used to have feelings for Ellie, but not that I still am. It's something that Max has been insecure about since moving in with myself, Ellie and Derek, which is understandable, considering I asked Max out, was rejected, asked Ellie out a couple weeks later, was also rejected, before I was asked out by Max a few months later. I've given Max all the reassurance I can, making sure they know that I will always be loyal, which isn't a lie, I would never cheat on them, nobody deserves to be cheated on, especially not with their best friend.   I'm at a loss at this point. Every single day it's all I can think about. I dread going to work in the morning because I know it's all I'll think about, and then I dread going home because it means I'll see both of them and think about it some more. Just last night, both Max and Ellie (in separate instances) asked me to open up about my mental health. I have a track record of putting others' happiness before my own, so I don't open up much. But what would I tell them? If I told Max I was in love with Ellie they would be devastated, and if I told Ellie I was in love with them, they would probably tell both Max and Derek, which would just be a bad situation all around.  I spoke with Max and told them that I've just been mentally and physically exhausted, which isn't a lie, just not the whole truth. Max gave me words of reassurance that I hadn't heard in a long time, and told me that I needed to get back into therapy, which I intend to do. Later I spoke with Ellie, who also told me that I need to go back to therapy, and that I love other people so much that I don't have any love left to give myself. Ellie is a very good judge of people and somehow always manages to emotionally peel me like a grape. I don't know how, but they can pick out parts of me that I didn't realize were there.   They were right, though. I love too hard. That's something I've known about myself for a long time. I give all the love I have out wherever I can, and never keep any for myself. I get attached easily, and then I keep giving more and more love until ultimately it becomes my downfall. My last relationship lasted two years, and the entire time I was being brushed off, cheated on, manipulated, and emotionally abused. The entire time I continued to give nothing but love. I just want to keep Max, Ellie, and Derek all happy. I just want to find peace.  TL;DR Both people I'm in love with are amazing and good to me, and it kills me not to be able to love both of them.

ThrowRA_4810348,My (18F) boyfriend (21M) thinks it's awesome that my friend (18F) is in love with him,434,14gn7py,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14gn7py/my_18f_boyfriend_21m_thinks_its_awesome_that_my/,202,2023-06-23 03:08:47,relationship_advice,"My boyfriend and I have known each other for 3 years, but we only started officially dating around the same time I turned 18, which was 6 months ago. Our relationship has been great, and literally no disruptions, fights, or problems have occurred between us until recently.  My friend group has always been aware of my boyfriend for the past 3 years that we've known each other, but obviously I didn't introduce him to my friend group until we started dating. Almost immediately I noticed some suspicious behavior on the part of my one friend (18F). For example she was always a very extroverted person, but once my boyfriend started hanging around us she suddenly became very shy. Then she started giving him random little gifts, while also constantly giving him weird compliments about how  amazing  he smells, and how  beautiful  his eye color is. The last straw was when she asked for his number in our Snapchat group chat, and after I privately messaged her to call her out on her inappropriate behavior she told me that my boyfriend and her  just have a better connection  than he and I do. This obviously infuriated me so I (regrettably) called her some names, screenshotted our conversation and then blocked her.  My boyfriend and I already had plans alone together later that night, and when I showed him the screenshotted conversation between my friend and I, he said  damn, she's really crazy about me  before chuckling and saying  that's awesome . I couldn't believe what I was hearing, and the entire situation had already messed with my emotions, so I just kinda froze and began to tear up a little (I couldn't control it).  He then got annoyed with me and said  I don't have time for your shit and I'm taking you home . I didn't say a word on the car ride home, and just sat their in silence with tears running down my face and the back of my throat hurting from trying to contain myself. It's now been 24 hours and he hasn't texted me or even tried to stop by to see how I'm doing, which really hurts. My anxiety is now off the charts also because I'm scared that he's chatting with my friend, or possibly even hanging out with her.  What is the best way to react to this nightmare?",1
Effective-Custard-82,My (30F) BF (31M) never speaks my love language and it's effecting our sex life and my stress levels. How do I get him to understand and satisfy my needs?,0,14f836b,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14f836b/my_30f_bf_31m_never_speaks_my_love_language_and/,13,2023-06-21 13:41:47,relationship_advice,"TLDR; My bf finds it hard to express love for me in my love language (physical touch) despite me repeatedly explaining it to him, and it's effecting my sex drive and our relationship as a whole. How do I bring this up to him without him taking it as criticism, and just making things worse?       more just want to vent, but advice is appreciated.      My bf and I have been together almost 5 years. Of course in the beginning things were a lot more affectionate because we were in the honeymoon stage and everything was great, but he never was much of a physical affection / PDA type of guy. In 2020 he went through a depressive spell that all but did away with his physical affection for me ( and by this I mean NON sexual physical touch, kissing, cuddles, hugs, etc) , and despite several very gentle attempts to explain to him my needs, it seemed like every time I would ask, the problem would only get worse. I did a couple times lash out in frustration after months of never having any emotional intimacy or physical touch from him but I would always apologize and explain calmly why I was feeling frustrated.      He has explained that he gets anxiety when he tries to give me what I ask for, because he thinks he's not going to do it right or I'm judging him when he does. We at one point we consulted a counselor, and all I really remember about the subject was that him and the counselor were trying to get me to modify my love language to suit him. I felt this was really unfair because he doesn't have to modify his (acts of service) for me to satisfy it. I do things for him all the time, not because that's what my LL is, but because that's what I know his is and i want him to feel loved.. and it feels like I don't get the same. A year or so ago I just gave up asking and for Physical affection and for a time things got a little better, he was more affectionate than before although still not as much as I'd like. I think not feeling pressured really helped.      Well again now he never shows me affection. I know some people are going to think that he just doesn't love me anymore, but that is not the case. He does things for me in HIS love language, and I see these things and while I appreciate them, they don't make me feel loved in the way physical touch does. The thing is, when I'm not feeling loved in the way I need, my sex drive goes to pretty much 0. I'm not the kind of person that just feels aroused for no reason like he does, I need to feel safe and loved and desired first. We've only had sex 1-2x in the past month, when we used to do it at least that much per week.   How do I bring this up to him without him taking it as criticism, and just making things worse?   And I feel like when I explain that I don't feel like having sex when I'm not getting physical affection it will come off as  since you're not doing what I want, I'm going to punish you by with holding sex from you  that is absolutely not the case as I love doing it with him, but I have to have a sex drive in order to do so.      I don't understand why it is so hard for him to have this emotional and physical intimacy with me, when I do what he needs so easily.",1

I’ll try to not make this post really long, but I need to get an outside perspective.   I am in the professional services business and recently the client that I tend to welcomed another professional in the team. At first I just noticed how cute he was, but he seemed to have a relationship (I saw a ring on his finger, where I live it indicates he might be engaged) but stayed professional and we had only professional interactions so far (he began about two months ago).  As time went on, we had more interactions and we always got along, another important piece of information is that we work from home, but call it whatever - he recently moved to my city (which is not that popular).  A couples weeks ago we were on the phone about work, and as conversations go we were talking about cool places in the city and what would be a good thing to do, next thing I know he was asking me to the movies. Against my better judgement, I went. It was the first time we saw each other in person and it was great - butterflies, he was cute, sweet and we had a great time. This first night we talked a lot and I asked if he had a girlfriend - he said he was engaged, but when he moved to my town he broke up the engagement because she didn’t wanna come with him.   A couple days passed, and we were seeing each other a lot, but now, my worst fear is real. Since I knew he was engaged just a couple of months ago I knew it was a risk, but I wasn’t planning on it becoming anything, even though we’re great together.   Recently he went to a diving trip with his friends, and it was the first time we didn’t see one another for a couple of days after we met. When he came back we talked and he said his ex was on the trip (according to him this was scheduled way before they broke up) and obviously to nobody’s surprise, she wants to get back together and is willing to try and move out here. They were together for 2 years and apparently liked each other a lot. I asked if they had any flashbacks and he said they didn’t, which was somewhat of an indicator to him and his dilema now - he said he needs to decide what he’s going to do. He’s a very logical person, but says that making decisions impacting other people is really hard for him.   Honestly I just feel like I suck each and every-time I try to get close to someone. So now, he can choose to somewhat continue what we have (whatever it is), get back with his ex or be single and mingle.   I didn’t ask for it, but he said he has enjoyed getting to know me, and finds meeting me fate or coincidence, because he didn’t expect this connection at all.   I just want to know if anybody has experienced something like this or if anybody knows what I should do - like run for the hills.  If you got this far, thank you for reading. Any words of wisdom are appreciated.  TL; DR:  I’m falling for my coworker, but he broke up his engagement a couple months ago and he might get back with his ex fiancée. I don’t know what to do.",1

I don’t sleep very well so am normally watching videos in bed for a couple of hours whilst she’s already asleep. She normally does not respond to anything I say or do when she’s asleep, except when I say I love you to her. Without fail, every single time I say I love her she always says she loves me too. I’ve been testing this out lately and have said things like “the house is on fire!” “The apocalypse has started!” but nothing.

She needed the toilet so I showed them where it was and said I would wait for them outside the doors to the mall (just a few meters away, as it was crowded).  I waited like 20 minutes then called and no answer. I eventually got a call saying they were in a shop the otherside of the mall, so I walked through the busy mall to that shop. They weren't there. I called them from inside the shop and no answer. I didn't want to be walking around forever so started walking to my place (only 10 mins from town) and I got all the way there before they called saying sorry they got distracted and were now in another shop further away. I said to just meet at mine.  An HOUR later it started raining and then they turned up. They said sorry they got distracted but they bought me a cake. They only stayed another half hour after that.  I know it's not a huge deal but I booked work off for this and turned down other plans. I just think it was really rude (mainly to not answer the calls or drop a quick text to let me know to meet somewhere else). Its made me cautious about hanging around with them again.

Details are important to understanding the title question. Fake names for privacy.  My sister Kayla (35f) has been married to her husband Isaac (38m) since I was 13. Important backstory: My mom and I had an awful relationship when I was in high school, for many reasons. She refused to teach me to drive when I turned 16, so Isaac taught me to drive in his expensive/fancy sports car, and we ended up spending 100+ hours together driving and bonding. I moved out of Mom's house after high school, to live with Kayla & Isaac. Isaac was always good to me, he fixed up my old clunker of a car more times than I can count, let me be late on rent a couple times (I worked 3 jobs to put myself through college), and bought me a new laptop when I needed if for school.  Kayla and Isaac are ~10 and 13 years older than me. I never considered them parental figures, but Isaac clearly saw himself as my  big brother . He was super overprotective of me and very intrusive in my personal life. When I was having boyfriend trouble (before I met my now-husband), he'd always try to get me alone to talk about it, and weasel private information out of me (are you still a virgin, what sexual acts did you do with this BF and that BF, etc). Then say he's trying to protect me and he doesn't want me to make mistakes that will jeopardize my future.  When I was in my 3rd year of college, my shitty BF Andrew cheated on me and I dumped him, and Isaac was very consoling and nice. He then thought that it was a good idea to fully admit he had a thing for me ever since he taught me how to drive (mind you, I was 16 back then). He said we really bonded and he fell in love with me, and has been in love with me ever since. And then he tried to bribe me for nudes. Legit told me he'd buy me a new, expensive piece of equipment I needed for school, if I sent him a nude photo.   Isaac was clearly unhappy in his marriage with Kayla. They had just had a baby and everyone in the house was stressed. I really don't know if he still loved my sister. He straight up told me that having a child didn't repair their relationship, it made it worse. Really fucking sad. When he asked me for nudes I was so caught off guard, all I said was  No, I don't think so  and then I went to bed. Nothing was ever said about it again.  I thought about telling Kayla about this conversation, but she had just had a baby and was struggling with PP depression. I could not put that on her. So even though I felt weird, I never told her. Since nothing else ever happened, I felt okay about keeping the secret. I made sure to never be alone with Isaac from then on, and became very guarded with what I said to him and how I dressed around the house.  Then, when I started dating my now-husband (Jim), Isaac became a jealous asshole and turned Kayla against me, wrongly assuming I was hiding things from them, and being sexually unsafe (absolutely none of his business as I was 21, but whatever). Isaac implemented a bunch of new  rules  while I was living under their roof. My relationship with both him and my sister broke. The day after college graduation, I moved in with Jim; two months later we moved halfway across the country so I could go to grad school.  Kayla and Isaac are still together. They've had another baby since then, so the kids are now 3 and 6. She and I are not as close as we once were and I don't know if we ever will be again. We also live about 2000 miles apart and only see each other once a year. I don't feel too guilty about keeping the secret from her now (6 years later), since I doubt Isaac still feels that way about me, and I am not trying to be a family-wrecker.  Jim and I have been happily married almost 3 years now. We tell each other everything, but I never did tell him this secret. At the beginning, I didn't want him to act weird around Isaac, and then as time passed it has just never been relevant. I hate keeping a secret like this, I've never even told a single soul (but now, all of Reddit knows haha). So, should I tell my husband?  **TL;DR:** Should I tell my husband that my brother-in-law creeped on me while I was in college, 6 years ago?",1

Also-- this is fully a stream of consciousness:  it's embarrassing how fucking in love I am in this moment. I don't think I've ever felt this passionately before. I'm literally crying right now thinking about those two. I can't wait to be with the both of them. I didn't realize how much I missed feeling the embrace of two sets of arms, but I don't remember feeling like this in that relationship. Maybe I've just forgotten, the ambrosia muddled by the dark, traumatizing times. or maybe this really is something different all together... well, yea, it definitely is.

Maybe that's what's driving me so fucking crazy right now. I really so deeply feel loved and have so much love for him, but I'm scared to express that, so the feelings are crashing in my head like water against a dam, wanting so badly to rush through and be freed. Well, right now I'm not scared, but the first time can't be over text. I need to tell him in person. OK brain? you NEED to tell him you love him on that next date. you NEED TO. I wish we told him last time he was here, fuckin coward! you chickened out! now I can't text him that because, again, it has to be in person the first time. He is too special to be told over text. and who fucking knows how long I'll be away from him this time?!

So me and this girl has been talking off and on for about 4 ears now. I got divorced from my wife and I messaged this girl who was in an abusive relationship and we kinda grew together while she was still stuck in this relationship she was living in. We ended up having sex and then shortly thereafter I told her I had feelings for my ex wife still (it was still kinda fresh) and I needed to figure things out and I didn't wanna hurt her. So she understood and she got out of her abusive relationship and got her own place. We kept in touch off and on over the next year and then we started getting close again (We never really faded feelings just didn't talk as much. And that continued for a couple weeks until she told me she was pregnant by someone else and I honestly didn't take it well and she took a step back to focus on her kids (she had two already and this would make 3) later that year after she had her baby we talked a little here and there and then at the start of this year ran into each other in a store and got a little more serious. In March we kinda made things semi official and planned a trip together but not really posted it (side note here, due to my court order me and her had read my papers and thought it had said I could not have anyone overnight while the kids were in my custody and I have full so it made things hard, more on that later) we talked like a couple and sent things like a couple but never hung out regrettably. She ended up telling me she loved me during this point and I was truthfully fighting my feelings and kinda downplayed it saying  you can't cause we don't know each other  and she said that we basically do, and she was right. Things were great up til the start of this month and she got really distant and told me it was because she was working two jobs and was just busy. Then about a week ago posted she was is in a relationship with someone new. I of course didn't react well to this either, not mad but just confused, and she ended up unfriending me which is fair. However I felt conflicted and I had to let her know that this whole time I loved her too and was just afraid to tell her. She accepted the message well and sent a heart and told me she would be here for me no matter what. Which was a relief. Yesterday I called her because even tho I voiced my feelings I didn't get a chance for her to communicate her own feelings and why she is with someone new out of the blue. She told me that we would go on this trip and it would be great but we would get back and we couldn't act like a couple and she told me that we are two best friends that love each other that have not got the timing right. Which was also nice to hear she still has feelings for me as well. After getting off the phone with her I went to check my paper and noticed that this whole time me and her had read the order wrong and it says if you are still MARRIED you cannot have another love interest around in the presence of the children and we could had been a thing this whole time. I told her and she was annoyed by this but didn't offer much else. So that's where I'm at. I love this girl. I know she loves me. And due to forces out of our control we have not yet got it right and I'm kinda lost rn with her getting a new relationship because she felt we couldn't be one. We both know we love each other but with her being in a new relationship because she felt we couldn’t be one, I’m torn. What should I personally do?  TL;DR- Me and my friend love each other and have feelings for one another but she just got into a new relationship right before we finally got into one because I didn’t tell her I loved her and we both misread a court order.

I've been on nofap for a while and I see myself sensitive to everything like if I just repoisition in the middle of the street I get turned on by the fact that I did it and there is people. The thing he provides me is kindness that I've never recieved in my life and what I am feeling making me start to think that I don't deserve him.  One time he did some gestures that really triggered me so I told him about what he did and how it made me feel. He was understanding of the situation and realised that he shouldn't have done it and what happened to me is normal. He doesn't know that I feel it always but this time was too intense that I had to tell him.. I am sure that he is 100% straight And what is happening to me is making me question tf is wrong with me. I don't want to lose him he means the world to me. But I am afraid I'd lose my sanity to deal with this everyday.

He’s working on setting boundaries with them but can’t do it yet (trauma related). We discussed this being an issue many times during our relationship (we were together for just over a year). I have cptsd and am extremely sensitive to certain situations and personality types, some of his family members trigger my cptsd.   The part that makes me feel so guilty and so sick that I could vomit, is that we broke up the day after his birthday because we had dinner with his family and I realised that these issues aren’t going to change any time soon and I can’t handle it anymore. I hadn’t planned on breaking up, I just wanted to talk about it and we decided to just end things after talking about it.   I feel horrible. I absolutely love him and don’t want this to be how it is but his family clearly don’t like me and I can’t mask the fact that it upsets me anymore. He’s not ready to set boundaries with them or let me defend myself in front of them.   How do I cope without the person I love? How am I supposed to deal with the fact that my trauma has ruined this for me? And he can’t possibly be happy with someone that can’t be around his family, even though he says he loves me too and doesn’t want to break up.  Mental health should obviously always come first but this hurts so much.   TLDR: I love my ex-boyfriend but can’t be around his family because they trigger my cptsd and I don’t know how to cope without the person I love in my life.   UPDATE: we’ve decided to meet up and discuss things realistically, I’ve told him I would need to go completely no contact with his family. We will be discussing whether or not that’s a possibility.  If he is willing to set boundaries then I’m willing to keep trying. Thank you for all your supportive messages and don’t worry, I am taking all of the advice in stride and I’m going into this with a clear head and willing to walk away if it’s not enough effort. I will update again tomorrow if anyone is interested.  UPDATE 2: Meeting up didn’t happen today, we’re meeting in person tomorrow but have spoken online and the general idea of tomorrows discussions are to work out how to move forward together.  UPDATE 3 *last update*: we have decided to continue dating, we’re both in therapy, I’m going to learn new strategies to cope with my CPTSD and he’s going to work on boundaries with his family. He’s already started putting them into place in conversations he’s been having with his family over the last couple of days. On top of that I’m going no contact with his family until we are both comfortable being able to set boundaries with them. He said he loves me too much to just let the relationship go without trying. We talked for hours about everything. There’s a much better understanding of each others mental health and what we require in terms of support from each other. Also his family has admitted to him that they don’t like me, they haven’t been able to give any reasoning for why they don’t like me though. I think that has really showed him that I’m not just overreacting and he’s standing up for me and not letting them say anything bad about me. Despite the fact that they want to. Anyway everything is going really well and we still love each other, the issues are being worked on and i think our relationship is stronger than before. Thanks everyone for all your feedback and lovely comments.",1
IAmNeutron,Am I (24M) wrong to expect love from my best friend (24F)?,0,13gq0km,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13gq0km/am_i_24m_wrong_to_expect_love_from_my_best_friend/,18,2023-05-13 19:11:25,relationships,"I met my friend (let's call B) in my undergrad. We were both undergrad in country X. We became best friend and we call ourselves the best gift that we got from our undergrad. I moved to the US for pursuing a PhD and she moved to a different country Y for work. I was doing a LDR with another girl till last summer but it didn't work out.  B never dated anyone. After a few months we discussed about the possibility of converting our friendship into a relationship - again long distance for me. We met last winter and had a really good time. We decided to give relationship a try while not explicitly calling ourselves in a relationship.  Both of us were majorly positive about it. Both of us had a few concerns about family compatibility, ambitions etc. I'm very ambitious but she wants a partner who'd not hesitate to spend all the time with her. I started loving her dearly and ready to compromise on most of the things except ambitions. She acknowledged it and feels I don't need to do this much for her.  Fast forward to last month, I asked her if she's feeling anything for me to which she replied it's 90% yes but I need a little bit more time. In the meantime she met a guy say C. They're friends and she goes out with him often. I had no problems with him. They (and other friends) went on a trip and after coming back she's saying she's totally over me. I asked if she doesn't want to date anyone to which she says she might think about C but not me. She feels C is a better choice majorly because of similarity traits. In the same time, my love kept increasing and now I'm stuck.  I know it's not wrong to not love me but I deserved a better ending. She wants to be friends with me (just like a year ago) but I don't feel like it. What should I do? Coming back to friendship is difficult for me given how sudden she changed. Since I love her I'm finding it difficult to completely cut off with her.  TLDR; Friends for six years, started loving her and we tried dating for some time but now she suddenly wants to get out of it and is instead falling for someone else. What should I do?",1

He lives out of state (2 flights away) so we met each other every 3-4 months for about 5 days each time. whenever we are together, it feels amazing. he felt like home. we really enjoyed our time together and I was very happy.   &#x200B;  However, last month I got to know that he was still talking to his ex. he had lied to me that they broke up a year ago and have not been in contact since. this ex was a very very long relationship, probably about 12 yrs. she lives abroad and so they have been doing long distance for over 8yrs. they have had continuous problems, dating on and off, taking breaks, him seeing other people etc. he has been trying to break up with her forever however had not had the courage to since their families are involved. his family and hers are in close contact as they've been dating for years. he faces extreme family pressure and backlash whenever he brought up breaking up with her in the past. mind you, we're from an Asian background and families are very tight-knit and hard to convince. when he met me, he was determined to go see both families and end it once and for all however, till then, he spoke to his ex on and off like any couple would. she thought they were still dating, although the facetiming was limited to probably 2-3 times a week, emotionless and distant.   he was a completely different person with me. he would call me countless times a day, respond to my texts within minutes, would check up on me all the time, would stay on call whenever I’m driving late night, would send me food if I hadnt eaten. And whenever we met, oh the butterflies! he would cook for us, cuddle me, treat me like no man had ever treated me before.   when I got to know this, I was devastated. his sister had involved my family into this problem, telling them to ask me to back off and all that drama. and so my family is completely against this relationship now. when I confronted him about this, he told me that he wanted to let his ex down softly, so that none of the parties would be hurt. I am having a hard time believing that he ever loved me and I am utterly confused as to if I can ever trust him again. I don’t know what to do.        **TL:DR - My boyfriend has family pressure and had trouble breaking up with his long term girlfriend of 12yrs. she lives abroad and theyve been doing long distance on and off. theyve been having problems for a while. he met me in the meantime and we experienced instant fireworks. when I got to know that he still talks to her, I was devastated. he told me his plan was to meet both families and end this but didnt want to lose me or keep me waiting along the way.

I felt ill and was trying to come down some and as I am achieving my goals in that manner he states how much he loves me. It gets more involved that night but this is the main part that meant something to me. I responded back immediately that I loved him too. The following day it was reconfirmed that he felt that way but to be fair, he wasn't back to himself because of the events that took place that night. I went on for almost a week thinking that my feelings were reciprocated. The next in-person talk was to go over the situation that took place and for him to apologize for saying things he might not fully mean. He cares about me a whole lot but it is too soon and too big of a step to say it. Devasted. Gutted. I have never felt so heartbroken in my life. He knows I feel this way because later on that night I lay in his arms crying and expressed it. I just received apologies and I care about you a lot. Obviously, that did not help the turmoil that I was fighting inside. I have never felt like this for anyone and I have reanalyzed my feelings over and over again well before this situation. I am certain I love him without a doubt because I doubted it so much when the feeling started developing. And yes, the infancy of the relationship, six months but I can't control how hard and quickly I feel for him. I wish he didn't say it because I would have kept it to myself and not had to deal with the rejection of being told that he really doesn't feel that way now thinking about it. I don't know what to do. I am so heartbroken. Any advice or similar situation that you have endured?",1

I am autistic so I have always been very socially  unusual  (a polite way of saying abnormal :c). I have a hard time connecting or even talking to people, but when I do, I connect in a very intense way. For me things are white or black, it is giving nothing or giving everything. I am extremely lonely. I live alone, I spend my days alone all the time. I know how to be alone and most of the time I feel good but other times I just cry for not being able to be like the others and have friends and live life in a normal way, have fun, laugh, etc. I've tried to hang out with people but I only end up overwhelmed for various reasons.   I only have one friend in the world, he is my best friend since high school, and another person who is also my best friend but at the same time the person I am in love with. I don't know what someone being love with me it's like, the only thing I know is one-sided love and sometimes I feel like I've gotten used to it.  This person is my piece of heaven and my sun. In a world where I always want to be alone because the world and the sounds and the entire life overwhelms me, next to him everything becomes a little easier to face, the weight of the world feels like a feather ♡ I love him with every atom that conforms me and I have proven it to him for the last 9 months. Notes, surprise gifts, drawings, a song written by me just for him, many compliments, many hugs. Everyday. Every Friday after college we would go for a walk close to the sea together.   The day before yesterday I spent what I consider the best day in a long time, because I had been obsessed with the Ferris Wheel that was put in the city for more than a year, but I had no one to go with and I did not like the idea of going alone. Little by little going to the wheel with him became a dream and he said yes. At first I felt very afraid, I couldn't even open my eyes, there was sooo many noises, so many lights, a lot of everything, but after several turns and seeing his eyes and feeling his hands with mine, I began to feel better and little by little I could open my eyes and see the beautiful landscape from above. We stayed a long time until we were taken down. Then we ate and then we stayed hugging. At some point I hugged him in such a way that my cheek was next to his and he kind of turned his head a little and our corners of our lips were together but I don't know if he noticed that. It was a curious moment for me. Yes I wanted to kiss him but I couldn't, it doesn't feel good because my love is one-sided.  I know that he feels comfortable with me (he has told me), I know that he loves me very much, that I make him very happy, we get along in an incredible way and our friendship is really very beautiful, although we are physically very close and people come to think that we are a couple, especially his friends, but we are not. Does he know I love him? Yes. I've been 100% direct with him, no filters or anything. Does he knows that it hurts me to death the fact that he doesn't love me? Yes, I have also told him.  I don't know what to do. He's too close to me but says he just can't fall in love with me and doesn't know why. It's not like he's a womanizer or anything like that, he doesn't really have experience in relationships and so, he came to tell me that sometimes that embarrasses him but I told him that he has nothing to be ashamed of, actually it seems tender to me.  I love him so much. With him I can be myself, I don't have to mask and pretend to fit in and feel normal, with him I don't exhaust myself. He's my best friend in college. A while ago, it didn't hurt, I only cared about making him happy even if it was not reciprocated but over time it began to hurt and now my only dream is that he will love me like i love him one day. I haven't told my neuropsychologist about this, I will do it next session, but I wanted to vent on the internet for a while and see some opinions. I feel undesirable, I feel strange, why can't anyone fall in love with me? I've given everything, I've really did...",1

Her name was Jenni. I barely knew her but felt that spark. Inspired, I wrote a song about her and recorded a rough version on a CD. I mustered up the courage to hand it to her at the water cooler, knowing it was likely my only chance of getting a date. That was a Friday and I spent the weekend regretting my decision since I hadn’t heard anything back. On Monday I saw a voicemail on my work phone–she apparently loved the song. A couple days later I got that first date! A few months later she confessed she listened to the song on repeat for days. And a few years later we are are happily married with two amazing children we both love more than anything. Jenni recently said it’s long overdue that I share this song with the world and let it inspire others to follow their hearts. So here’s the song, [Again and Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O461NL-GKaw), with love ❤️",1

Her confidence was shot and it took her about 18 months to find a new one. I racked up about $25k in high interest debts supporting her. I know this was probably a mistake, and I absolutely accept and admit that I also made some poor decisions here, but a majority of that money was spent on bridging the gap from her loss of income; I love her and wanted to show her same support that was shown to me by my loved ones in my early 20s when I was going through some similar things. She is working now, and is contributing enough to cover her share of expenses.  Back in March, I graduated with my bachelor's and I have a job lined up in a new city. The job pays really well and will set me up for a good career in my field. However, due to the increase in rent, my net financial situation will not change or will get slightly worse. I'll have about $700/month left over for groceries, health insurance, student loan payments, and incidentals. I don't need to tell you how quickly that's gonna go.  I was laid off last month from the job I had while going through school. We have enough saved to move, and I'm collecting UI, but I'm having the rely a bit on friends and family to make up the sudden difference in the meantime. I am looking, but we live in a small town, there are not many jobs, and many of jobs that are available are part time and do not pay as well as UI.  My girlfriend is planning on transferring to a new location in the city with her employer. However, I have several concerns here:  * In the 5 years I've known her, she's had 5 jobs, and has been unemployed for about 24 months in aggregate. Her ability to hold a job is suspect, IMO. At first I thought it was just because she worked with shitty people, but after 5 jobs and 3  terminations, I have to ask. As mentioned above, I will have very little money left at the end of the month; if she loses her job after we move, I will be in an extremely tight or negative cash-flow situation. There is a real chance that I would have to declare bankruptcy.  * speaking of bankruptcy, I will be working in a field where, while not a career-killer, is definitely career-limiting. If I was 25, I would be less concerned, but at my age I have serious concerns over how it will affect my career trajectory and earning potential, as well as my other financial goals. I've already suffered a significant setback in taking on that debt.  * I've shown her a rough financial breakdown of what the move is gonna look like, have flat out told her that I dont think we can afford one, and she won't shut up about buying a car. All of the ones she's looked at are mid-00's domestic makes with 100k+ miles. I'm not a car guy by any means, but I've known enough people with these cars to know they just don't last more than a year or two. I can't get her to consider an import, even though she seems to like mine just fine. Even then, it might be bearable if it was a cash purchase from Craigslist or some shit, but she keeps looking at financing through dicey dealerships.   * I've been paying over $700/mo on the loans I took out to refinance the debts incurred from her period of unemployment. I've made it clear several times that I really wanted to get the smallest one paid off before we move to free up some cash flow that we can use in a new, more expensive city. Despite agreeing to this, she has done very little of the things we talked about doing to tackle this, has volunteered no information, and becomes incredibly defensive if asked.  I feel like shit for making this about money, but I really don't feel like it's fair to me and all of my hard work to put myself in a position where my career might be hamstrung before it even gets off the ground. On top of that, her actions, or lackthereof, through the last few years don't inspire much confidence. If I broke up with her and moved in with a friend, I could cut the amount of money I would need to survive until this job starts by 60%   here are other issues too, but you can check my post history for that, but to summarize I just really don't feel like a partner in this relationship   I feel like I've tried everything to make this work; I'm out of ideas and nearly out of energy. Is there anything left here?  TL;DR  GF can't hold a job and has questionable financial literacy. This has led me to take on a lot of debt to support her. I am moving to a new city to start a career, but I don't have a lot of confidence in her ability to retain financial stability and if she loses it, I will be in a very bad spot personally and professionally. I don't see a way to make this work or a reason to try anymore. Do you?",1

For those not in the know (and eventually, there will come a time that newcomers to Reddit won’t know), [on June 5, 2023, the mods announced that this public sub would be participating in a planned sitewide blackout](https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/141d4y7/on_june_12_2023_this_subreddit_will_be_going/) in protest of some changes Reddit had unilaterally made to its business practices that impacted many users. After that initial blackout, [we posted a poll asking the community how we should proceed,](https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/14a1oaf/were_active_again_although_restricted_we_want/) and you instructed us to open up, which we did. Many subs, though, actually stayed closed in protest. [The blackouts were really hurting Reddit’s bottom line ahead of their rumored IPO.](https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/20/reddit-usage-metrics-fall/)   Those subs that chose to go close [were soon hit with messages from the Admins directing them to open up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14ffsk8/reddit_is_a_bully/) Most tried to fight it, but let’s be real, the Admins hold all the power and can forcibly re-open a sub if they really want to.  #Most subs chose to re-open  In the spirit of malicious compliance, though, some opted for one of three paths of continued resistance:  1. They made their re-opening an excuse to change their rules in a funny way in order to further protest (see e.g., r/pics (John Oliver pics), r/wellthatsucks (vacuum pics));  2. [They chose to revise their rules in such a way that sub metrics would be slowed down considerably, so as not to give Reddit any precious traffic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/14en4w5/welcome_to_the_18th_century_how_to_reddit_now/); or  3. They re-opened as NSFW subs in order to deprive Reddit of ad revenue ([Reddit won’t sell ads on NSFW subs](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditforBusiness/comments/bdwlin/update_to_nsfw_advertising_policy/)) (see e.g., r/interestingasfuck, r/ShittyLifeProTips, etc., although those subs might be scrubbed of porn by the time you read this).  The Admins’ reaction to 3 wasn’t great. [They unilaterally and very suddenly nuked the entire mod teams of those subs from orbit and suspended each of the moderators.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14eyx90/comprehensive_list_of_all_subs_with_mod_teams/) Honestly, Reddit probably doesn't care about 1, because they’re still getting traffic and ad space. How they react to 2 remains to be seen.  (In the meantime, ire by many had risen to the point that [Reddit felt compelled to take certain sitewide measures.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/14fi8d4/admins_have_started_removing_posts_insulting_spez/) But that’s neither here nor there.)  Reddit’s arbitrary and summary removal of mods (see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14efshe/removed_from_rsearchandrescue_which_was_public_in/) as another example, although there are many others) has completely demoralized its cadre of volunteers. Some mods [quit](https://www.reddit.com/r/simpsonsshitposting/comments/14cr42v/i_always_new_someday_the_mods_would_violently/), and several people who had provided volunteer services to Reddit [for over a decade left Reddit for good](https://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/comments/14fxzr4/so_long_and_thanks_for_all_the_fish/).   #So what does all of this mean for r/love?  Well, it’s quite a pickle. On the one hand, F ‘em. The mod team has no desire to volunteer its services in order to make money for a corporate entity that will so callously and recklessly toss aside its volunteers the minute they become inconvenient. They want to get rid of us? Fine. Go ahead. F you. One of our mods already quit in disgust and another is on hiatus for unrelated reasons, but is unlikely to come back. Another mod is an alt, so that only leaves us with one human mod for this sub.  On the other hand, though, it’s the users of r/love who will be caught in the middle in this fight. You didn’t sign up for all this nonsense, and we shouldn’t deprive you of the sub just because we’re mad as hell at the Admins.  #Tl;dr  After a lot of thought and discussion, **we’ve decided the only thing we can do that would be the fairest to all sides is to re-open the sub, go back to business as usual, but remind you all that Reddit doesn’t care about you or its volunteers (mods and developers) who helped build the community into what it is today.** The rules will stay the same, but moderation may not be able to be as responsive as it was in the past. As always, please report content that breaks the rules.  [We encourage you to find Reddit alternatives.](https://www.staygrounded.online/p/reddit-is-a-dying-mall)",1

We had been acquantances for a bit, they'd comment on my art and I'd comment on their posts. A bit after, they offered to play a game with me and we did it. It was very fun, we had a lot of laughs but we never played the game again.      We shared socials so we could be more in touch and started talking morning to nights everyday until one day they asked me out. It all fell a little too rushed to my own taste (especially after me not being in a relationship for years) but it felt right in a certain way and I did not want to hurt their feelings rejecting them as we had already been treating one another as partners either way.      I had particularly noticed that they mostly talked about themselves and that they didn't ask much about me unless it was via text. Even then they'd admit it by going  you probably know a lot more about me than me about you  but that we would get to it eventually and whatnot. Didn't think much out of it.      We got to saying our first I love yous and getting into daily nightcalls were we would play games or one of us would share our screen doing whatever while on call. But I would often be talked over, even when I would interrupt to continue my sentence I still got talked over. Wanted to see how far this would go tonight when I barely said a single word other than agreeing with everything they said and we ended up spending a solid hour and a half just talking about them. Never asked me anything about me, just kept on going on a ramble about themselves.      They've said in the past that they appreciate me just listening to them as they had been in  very awful  relationships were  people used them and just hurt them  and all other reasons were they were never the ones to blame - but I am starting to wonder if this is actually true. When talking about the future, it's mostly about all the things they will do with me, rather than the things we'll do together. It's always very self-centered from my POV.      I have not talked to them about this yet as this will very likely hurt them - however it is tiring me rather quickly to spend nights just listening to them talk about themselves for hours, with maybe just one quick pause to ask me something and then interrupt me. I think they are more in love with the idea of being with someone who actually listens to them ramble all the time rather than with me as a person.      Worth mentioning I don't mind listening to them talk but I believe a relationship should be two people talking with one another rather than one acting as a free therapist and the other one being the patient.      Will very likely talk about this with them tomorrow, but just wanted to vent it out and possibly get some recommendations from you fellas. Thanks!  &#x200B;  **TLDR: My partner only talks about themselves all the time and I feel bad to eventually talk to them about it knowing it will hurt their feelings.**",1

When someone thinks of me, considers me, remembers things, & just sees me & gives me love. When a person thinks about how they can be loving or show up better, & does that. Receiving that kind of love made me want to be more intentional with my love. I started to become aware of the multitude of ways love shows up & can be shown, & tried to step into that energy of loving on purpose whenever I could. I pray for my peoples, I speak aloud the beauty I see in them, I show up present in every moment (of course w room for human error like being overwhelmed or unaware at times), as well as show & tell people how much I love them as often as possible. I try to show my love through every love language, & those unspoken. I notice things & give my best to be loving & caring, even to strangers at times. I’ve been so blessed with love in this life, & I’ll never stop sharing it 💖",1

Excuse my english, excuse everything. Reposting this.      Context:      I have been dating my girlfriend, J, for 5 years now. She is perfect, smart, beautiful, kind... I am madly in love with her, like crazy in love.      I also have been friends with L for 5-6ish years, in fact, I met J through L, because he had been her male best friend since childhood.      So, L is both mine and my girlfriend's best friend. He is truly a great guy, funny, loving...      Anyone who is not blind would quickly realize L has been in love with J for his whole life. He has never told me that openly, because, you know... she's my girl, but it is just so obvious. Everybody knows.      J does not appear to know about L life long crush on her and I have never questioned her about it.      It has never bothered me neither (until know). She has 0 romantic interest for him and treats him like a brother. He is respectful and does not push things with her nor does anything out of ordinary friend-type things.      I thought L would eventually grow out of it, you know, find another girl and move on. But he has not.      I have recently moved in with J and I think I am starting to go crazy.      It all started when I found them 'hiding' in the garden and whispering to eachother. I approached and they suddently stopped talking. I wondered what the hell where they doing, talking behind my back or something...      I did not get upset or cause a scene but I started thinking. I kept wondering about what else they could be doing behind my back.      I started noticing the little things. How he looks at her, how she looks at him. The way he puts his hand in her back when hugging, the way she slaps his arm jokingly when talking about something.      I started resenting him, I could not even bear the sight of him, but I put on a happy facade for J while I figured things out.      Then I found what they were whispering about in the garden. A secret birthday party. For me.      So I have build all of this resentment toward him for nothing.      But I just can not get over it. Maybe it was nothing this time, but what if she realizes that he is in love with her and goes 'oh sh\*t, then maybe we are just meant to be' and leaves me...      L is so much better than me.      I am an extrovert, I am good looking, I am wealthy. That's it. From the outside I look like a good catch, but I am not. I am a bad person, a toxic one, an awful boyfriend and an awful friend.      I am like a gift with a very nice wrapper but that is full of nothing, empty.      J tells me she wants to go out with her friends. I think: 'No, I want you to stay here with me. I do not want you to go anywhere where I am not present.', and I say: 'Sure my love, have fun!'.      J tells me she will not be available to meet on Sunday because one of her friends dad just passed away. I think: 'I do not care about that girl or her father. I want you to be available for me, on Sunday and always', so I say: 'Do not stress about it. My condolences to her and her family'.      I feel like I am rotten inside. I pretend in front of others this 'good-guy' persona, but that is not who I am.      If it was for me, she'd be MY princess trapped in MY castle. Only there for me, and up until now, for L, who I trusted with my life.      On the other hand, L is good. He is simply good. He always does the right thing, he always has everyone's best interest in mind. He is the human form of a Golden Retriever.      I wish he would disappear.      Eventually my good-guy persona will slip, J will realize that I am an absolute a-hole and that the perfect guy was just next to her all this time, in love with her since the beginning of times.      The only good thing about me is that I have her. Being with her makes me better. She is so good that it even rubs off on me a little. I can not lose her.      I do not know what to do about this. I do not want to confront her over literally nothing and I do not want her to think that I am this paranoid and f\* things up.      About L, I simply can not stand him. When we are alone together it's fine, but when she's around I see how he looks at her and I just get livid.      This is very long and dramatic.      What should I do? Talk to her? Cut him off? Pretend everything is fine like I have been doing?      TLDR: My girlfriend and I have the same best friend. He is a very good guy and he has been in love with her for his whole life. I am extremely paranoid she will leave me for him, because he is a great guy and I am a toxic, selfish person. I have gone from loving him to not being able to see him because of the jealousy he causes me. I do not know what to do about it.",1

I have known this friend for 2 years (she’s 23 and I’m 21), she’s a great friend and we talked together a lot, we exercised together, and just bonded together, and now that we’ve both finished university, I truly realised how much I love her.   I have pretty much always had feelings for her, but my heart now aches for her and I can’t do anything about it for a while. I’ve never felt this way before.  I will see her again in about two months, (we’ll be interning and I’ll travel to see her), and this is when I want to confess.  How do I ensure that I’m not so over the top, or maybe too nonchalant when confessing? And maybe there are other things I should keep in mind?  She’ll be moving to Paris for a masters degree while I stay in England for a PhD, meaning we can only really see each other in the holidays, but that would only be for 3 years if she decides to pursue anything with me.

He’s gone back to school and our schedules have been really busy but there’s days we won’t even speak to each other. To be quite honest I don’t think our relationship has ever been worse. Me and his mom are really close so I tend to confide in her. He is also really close to his mom. She often acts like a mediator. Our last conversation I told her that we barely speak to each other anymore and she told me that her last conversation with him he was telling her how he loved me and wanted another kid which completely caught me off guard. Well idk what to do because I’m honestly  ready to leave the relationship because I’ve tried so many times talking to him about how we’re growing apart but a lot of the time he just doesn’t want to hear it and simply won’t talk to me.,1

And I've been in a lot of messy situations. I don't even know how to start.  I guess I'll start with me and my roommate, Em. I met Em almost 2 years ago in highschool through a mutual friend, my best friend. I couldn't stand the girl, I was jealous of how close she was with my friend because I felt like I was being replaced. Still, she came with us everywhere. And she started to grow on me, at least to where I felt neutral about her. Fast forward a little less than a year after graduation, 9ish months, I'm kicked out of my parents place, living in my abusive exs parents basement with him. Not a fresh breakup, we'd been broke up for a year and a half. Im busting my ass doing 70 hour weeks trying to scrape together enough for an apartment asap. I text my best friend asking if she'll join me. No, she likes her moms place. A few hours later she texts me saying  em wants to know if she can.  (Come to find out later she'd told em I'd asked, roommate cupid kinda deal.) And I'm thinking fuck, this girl? But my ex is getting more abusive by the day and I need OUT. So I agree.  Things are comfortable immediately. We click. Best friends, perfect roommates. And as the weeks go by we click more and more. We have identical music taste, identical clothing style, identical hobbies and sense of humor. We sing every song in the car together, I have her food order memorized, I talk to her more openly than anyone else, we can recognize each others moods immediately and damn near read each other's minds. We also have the same issues though. Wreckless, unable to slow down, eating disorders and addictive personalities(addicted to people, spending money, borderlining on alcoholism). But we keep each other in check for the most part, especially with our eds. She understands me to the fullest extent and I feel like i fully understand her too.   And I'm thinking to myself from almost the beginning, oh man I like this girl a lot. I haven't liked a girl since middleschool but her she's something else. The prettiest, funniest, most exciting girl I've ever met, and I know she likes women too. But I ignore it. And I ignore it. For months. Until fuck, I can't ignore it anymore she gets more perfect by the day. I'm writing shitty poetry, I'm thinking about her every minute, I miss her when she's not around. And then something big happens that makes it spiral worse. But before that, I need to switch gears.  A month ago, an ex of mine from highschool comes with a few of my friends to visit. Me and him hit it off, and he ends up staying the whole week after the leave and every weekend since. And her...she started talking to my cousin a few weeks ago. She's attached already. I like my dude alright, but he won't make it official despite me asking. Everytime he comes over its mainly sex. And my cousin is the most sexist prick, and within a few weeks is already insulting her and draining her bank account. But she really likes him. And me and mydude kind of do make sense if he'd just commit.  But last Friday, it was me her and my cousin drinking like we do every weekend. Me and her got too drunk(he likes to bartend and get us more messed up than we meant to be while he stays mostly sober.) I look at her, tell her shes beautiful and my cousin should tell her that. She grabs my face and before I know it we are on the ground, tongue in mouth. She's telling me she wants to be more than roommates, I'm telling her I've wanted this forever. My cousin is just watching, hell we think he was recording but the memories are blurred. Eventually he drags me off her and me and him start arguing. Memory blackout, now I'm crying on the couch to him with her in bed. He's saying I can have her and he doesn't really want her anyways. I eventually pass out and vomit everywhere, and when I wake up on the floor my first thought is fuck what did I do. My second thought is fuck, my dude.(he didn't care, said i wasn't really his so I could do anything with anyone and he wouldn't care.) When I see her again, it's awkward at first. But it goes back to normal, like it didn't happen.  When he leaves the room I tell her what she says and she immediately says she doesn't feel like that and so I lied and agreed it was just the shots. When my best friend asked, she said it was out of respect for me and my guy that she didn't. But she is so attached to my cousin, even knowing what he told me. I just don't know how to move forward. After all of that I've had constant butterflies in my stomach, i cant think of anything else, and I can't look at her the same.",1

She's beautiful, smart, charismatic, loving, caring, and just an absolute rock. She's genuinely fun to spend time with, be that cooking, housework, or driving. She makes even mundane tasks enjoyable for me. I love her dearly, and I can easily imagine spending the rest of my life with her.  Our relationship is somewhere between short and long-distance. We live one state away from each other: she lives in a major city and I live in another state in the city's suburbs. It's only a 40 minute drive to see her, which I often make.  I hate the city noise, traffic, congestion, culture, etc. Just all of it. I despise it. I'm fine going to the city to see a play or a concert but I do not want to live there.  She was born in the city, has friends and family there, and wants to live out her 20's there, but her lease is up, and her flatmate plans on moving out in a month or two.  She wants me to move in and cover half the rent, pay for parking (for my ancient car), and cover half of everything else (food, utilities, tolls, etc.).  My salary is significantly below hers. She makes a bit over 6 figures and I'm stuck well under 90. I am in desperate need of a new car ('05 with >170k miles). I live basically rent-free with family, helping the entire family as a form of rent (while working my job).  I'm struggling to save as it is. I did a rough calculation and came up with a figure that living with her for one year would cost roughly $25k, not including food or utilities, just rent, tolls (I work in my home state, as does she).  When I mentioned this to her, she got very upset and said  it seems like you want a new car more than you want to live with me,  which honestly is not that far off.  Not because I'm considering only myself, but because it's impractical to live with her, save for a car, have an emergency fund, invest in my retirement, and go on the occasional vacation while I'm young and healthy.  When I bring this point up to her, she says that we can cook more food at home and order less take out, however, that doesn't even apply to the $25k figure, it's only what's over it.  When we talked about moving to the suburbs, she argues that apartments there are more expensive (fair, it would be roughly a $400 increase per month per person, but easily worth it, IMO) and that she would still need to pay for tolls and parking for her job (also true).   She also doesn't have a driver's license and can't drive because she never felt the need to, prior to meeting me. She is 29 and I have been asking her to get her license for years now. Since we started dating, she got her permit and two or three road lessons. She also has been to multiple countries for vacation, so I don't think anyone could argue it's a matter of a lack of free time.  I don't know what to do. I could easily see marrying her, but if we can't ever find way to live together, it seems pointless.  TL;DR: She argues that she doesn't want to make the ultimate sacrifice of moving away from her friends and family in the city. I don't care about the distance to my friends and family so much, but I don't tolerate city life well. We want to live together but are struggling to make it work.  Edited to Add: She has already made it clear she'd be cool with moving to suburbia by 2026, and that we'd raise our child/children outside of the confines of the city.  Update: One correction, her roommate is moving out *because* I'm expected to move in.  Furthermore, she found this post (holding it up to me and saying  was this you? ) and we had a heart-to-heart conversation last night/this morning. She wants to start couples therapy and considered breaking up with me. This post really upset her, but we're trying to work through it. I'm planning on compromising and moving in with her in the coming months.  I can't believe she found this, but I guess I did this to myself. Next time there's strife, I'll talk it out with you babe, I love you. ❤️",1

I found “slow burn” love stories in novels and movies to be incredibly boring and never pictured my own love story to be that way.   However, that’s exactly what happened and I’ve never been more grateful for it. I’ve watched my boyfriend go from a stranger to an acquaintance, an acquaintance to a friend, a friend to a best friend, and now from a best friend to a lover.  If you had told me a year ago that Id be dating the person I am now, I would have scoffed in your face, but I’m happier than I’ve been in so long. I’m so lucky he’s mine, and he’s no longer “just a friend”.  I felt myself falling for him bit by bit as time went on. The tiny things I found cute. Feeling myself smile when I get a notification from him. Getting excited whenever we were planning on hanging out. All the times we’ve fallen asleep on FaceTime. Realizing my feelings and keeping it from him for so long, scared he didn’t feel the same way.  I think the best part of knowing him for a long time before we started dating is we skipped the awkward stage. I don’t feel like I need to be perfect around him because he’s seen me at my worst and I’ve seen him at his and we’ve accepted each other for it long before we started dating.  We already know each others likes and dislikes, met each others families, know about each others pasts. While there’s obviously still so much to learn about each other, we get to fast forward past the whole “getting to know each other” bit.  I could go on and on about the million other reasons I’m glad we were friends first, but this post is getting long so I’ll wrap up here, haha.  I’m so lucky I get to wake up every day and call him my boyfriend. I cant wait to see what the future holds for us.",1
