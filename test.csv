hmboo,I (29F) am moving into my boyfriend’s (27M) apartment but he is rigid about me changing details in the decor/set up,181,143nwe0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/143nwe0/i_29f_am_moving_into_my_boyfriends_27m_apartment/,57,2023-06-07 20:24:38,relationships,"To preface my boyfriend is incredibly sweet, attentive and loving. We overwhelmingly have positives in our relationship, but are having a situational communication snafu about our stuff coming together in the apartment he is renting/we will be renting together soon.  He and I have discussed for a few months that he wants me to move into his apartment when my lease is up soon. Very exciting step as we are also discussing getting engaged before the end of the year.  The apartment he is renting came to him fully furnished because his close family member had lived here and left all of this furniture/kitchenware when he got married (his wife didn’t want his stuff/had a fully furnished place—then my boyfriend started renting it the next month after moving from out of town). None of the furnishings are items that my boyfriend purchased (besides some kitchen stuff we will absolutely keep). This family member lived here for 10+ years and honestly the amount of stuff left over from them is overwhelming. I’m talking my boyfriend just moved his clothes/shoes in. I’ve worked with him to clear out items in his own closet, but the closet/room I am supposed to move my clothes and desk into are still not a workable space to start that project on my end.  Every time I bring up something that would be helpful to make me feel more at home when I move in, it’s met with resistance and a change in mood (short responses, saying he feels like he’s “just here” and has no say despite me saying he does and explaining that it’s just a few changes, etc). I’m talking asking if we can turn the bed in the guest room a different direction to fit my desk and move the printer to another room will make him moody.  I also purchased a lot of my items over the years that I’m planning to move in (nothing crazy but rugs, my desk, newer towels, some kitchen and organizational stuff), so I feel like the items that were left here should either go to the person who left them or, if they don’t want it, go to a donation center because I actually bought/chose my rugs/decor and planned to use it long term. The person who left them also has multiple furnished rental properties he can bring stuff to and put to use. If I had it my way it would all go, but I’m trying to meet in the middle somehow.  This apartment doesn’t feel like a home to me, it feels like we’re just living with someone else’s stuff they didn’t want. I’m trying to make it a bit more home-y to me with some fresher decor by slowly moving stuff starting with the kitchen to not overwhelm him, but I don’t know if I should just change a few things and ask for forgiveness after at this point or what.  This may be a factor in his reaction too, but my partner didn’t grow up with very much and his parents came to this country with nothing and I think it’s hard for him to let go of stuff that still functions (even if you never use it) —which I get and am sensitive to. He also is very nostalgic (we cooked in that pot growing up that my mom gave me, type of thing). We are financially at a point though that he can update a few things/part ways with it for newer stuff (that I already have/we aren’t purchasing). I’m a purger/minimalist and he’s more nostalgic. I also work in areas where change happens constantly so I’m more fluid/it stresses me out less.  How do you communicate that things are changing in the home soon if the other person is rigid about it in a way that’s constructive. We can’t hold onto this family members stuff forever and honestly it’s putting a strain on our communication during a time that should be exciting and I find myself getting upset at his reactions.  TLDR: boyfriend won’t let me change anything in the apartment that is furnished with stuff his family  member left. His reaction to me wanting to replace these things with my stuff I purchased over the years is putting a strain on me feeling like this place will be my home too.  Edit: more info in comments",1
heavenlyriver,Should I Love a Friend ?,1,13ybqgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13ybqgb/should_i_love_a_friend/,4,2023-06-02 12:44:36,relationships,"Around a year ago, I (25M) made a new friend (23M.) We hit it off instantly and in no time became in my inner circle of friends. I am part of a community project that offers trainings sessions for a specific field, and since he fits the sought after profile, we were both looking forward for him to participate in our next session, and I would be in the organisation team. Because of other engagements, I could not be involved in this session, so I didn't have any role, and I wished him a pleasant experience without me. Coincidentally, he was not selected for the residential training and was as a result pissed off. He claims that he was guaranteed to get in, and there was only one loophole for it not to happen: me. He threatened to use his connections to make a halt to the project as a whole, to which I said it would compromise not only my professional engagement but relationships I've created with my colleagues as well. I added that if he purposefully managed to harm the project, that my relationship with him (platonic) would also be compromised. He said he felt angry and betrayed, and that he didn't care about these relationships.  One thing we share: I also felt betrayed. I didn't think he would so easily give up on our friendship, and what's more, it's based on a false assumption/accusation. Trust is very important to me, and now I don't feel trusted, which hurts. When we had this conversation, I shared my disappointment in that he won't do something he was looking forward to, and that I understand he is upset. I did not engage further with what I consider threats because I thought (or hoped?) he did not really mean it. After all, we all sometimes say hurtful things to the people we love.  This happened five days ago,  Should I contact him again first or let him process his emotions at his own pace and wait for him to text me back himself ? If it comes down to if and I realise he really does not trust me or does not value our relationship, should I keep him in my inner circle, as a casual friend, or not at all ?    TL;DR: My (25M) friend (23M) is angry at me because he thinks I acted against his favour. He threatened my project and said he doesn't care about our relationship anymore (1 year long, intimate friendship.) It's been five days. Should I text him or wait for him to do so ? Should I continue to invest in this friendship ?",1

Ok_Flower4204,I (32F) was in love with my friend (29F) for almost a year. Her wedding is in a few months. Do I speak now or forever hold my peace?,0,149acyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/149acyg/i_32f_was_in_love_with_my_friend_29f_for_almost_a/,21,2023-06-14 15:10:06,relationships,"TLDR: I (31F) was in love with my friend/co-worker (30F) for about a year, but never told her because she was in a relationship. She's getting married soon and I feel uncomfortable attending her wedding with all of the unspoken things between us, but I want to support her. I think there's still something there, because she made a comment about me objecting at her wedding. Do I tell her the truth, or do I attend the wedding and forever hold my peace?         So, I first met this friend (let's call her Jen) online through work. I remember liking her a lot as a person right off the bat, but not romantically. We worked together for almost a year online, then in person. After being in person for a few months, my ex (33M) ended things with me (it was a really toxic relationship for us) and Jen was really supportive. At this point, I knew I loved being around her, enjoyed her company and everything. We had a special connection, I looked forward to seeing her at work every day, I was happy just to be around her, I admired her, I was a bit critical about her bf- but I didn't really think twice about having feelings.      About 4-5 months after my break up, we decided to take magic mushrooms together. I had tried going on a date the night before and I was really emotional and sad that morning, but I knew being around her would just make me feel better. During the trip, we had this moment we were laughing, and I looked at her and thought  wow she is so beautiful.  Despite wanting to marry my ex, I never felt this way about him before, during or after the shroom trip I took with him.      After this, I felt like I saw her in a different light, and the immense joy I had always felt around her before this intensified. Now, I saw her as beautiful and started to get major butterflies. There were many moments we shared, comments that were exchanged, that made me think she felt the same way. When I told my close friends about the exchanges and the types of comments made, they were also convinced she had feelings for me as well. We were inseparable at work, we texted almost every day, we made each other laugh deeply, and the exchanges between us felt charged. I'd never felt this happy to be around anyone in my life, not even long term partners I had had before.      One night, we had a drunken conversation in which I came out to her, and we talked about crushes on other friends. She told me that I should tell people how I feel about them. This was an opportunity to tell her, but she was trying to sober up and drive home, and I didn't want to ambush her with that kind of information as she was getting ready to drive home late at night. This was only one of several exchanges that made me think there might be mutual feelings. But, she was already taken and living with someone.      There came a point where I had to decide to stay on a team with her or move to another team. She told me she would not want to work there unless it was with me, which was a lot of pressure. Then, she told me by text that she was going to quit, but that I was the reason she was so happy coming to work every day. I told her I felt the same. Ultimately, she decided to stay, but my decision after that was difficult.      As much as I loved working with her, because at this point I knew I was in love with her, I felt like continuing, knowing she is in a committed relationship, would be unhealthy for me. Being around her knowing I had very little chance of being with her started to feel really heavy and painful.      I decided to quit my job completely, and tried to tell her my feelings for her several times over the following few months, but I got the feeling she was avoiding me. Every time I tried to have a talk with her or meet with her, she found a way to avoid me. I think I hurt her feelings by leaving her, and I think she almost did not want to have a deep conversation with me.      Well, I was offered a job in a city far away, and I accepted it, hoping to have a fresh start and get away from all of the recent heart break of my break up and now her. I felt like our relationship shifted after my decision to quit, and even more so after my decision to move. She was very supportive, and we stayed connected and kept in touch, but I was still very in love with her for months after I moved.      About 5 months after I moved, she called to announce she got engaged. Long before this, I had accepted that she would choose her partner, that she would never break it off for me, even though I had never even tried because I didn't want to try to interfere in her relationship. My heart sank, but I told her I was happy for her. She asked if I'd be at her wedding, and I said yes.      About a month later, we met up for dinner, and she spent most of the time talking about her wedding planning, but there was a specific comment she made that really threw me off. She asked if I'm coming to her wedding again, then followed with  It would be so funny if you objected at the wedding.       This was like a bomb was dropped. I got really embarrassed and looked away, asking her why I would do that. She shrugged and played off that she didn't know and that she was just joking. Looking back, I realize this was the perfect opportunity for me to just tell her how I felt, but I was so flustered back then I just didn't know what to say.      The next day, I had a full flown panic attack thinking about what the comment means. I felt that this must mean she KNOWS I had feelings for her, and that she wanted me to tell her. But I also wondered if this meant she WANTED me to object. Did she want me to give her a reason to end the engagement? I texted her to ask why she made that comment, but she said it was just a joke and there was nothing underneath it. I felt like this was a lie, but I wasn't being honest. I decided to take space from her for a while, and I didn't see her again for 6 months, even though we had a few phone calls/text exchanges in between.      But, Jen is getting married soon, she fully expects me to be at her wedding. Our relationship feels very different, even awkward now. I saw her recently and something feels off. It's not how it was before my decision to quit my job.      So, the advice I need here is- with the wedding approaching, I feel very uncomfortable attending, knowing that our friendship is not based on truth, and worried that my love for her might make watching her get married painful. I have not been honest with her at all about how I have felt about her, or why I created distance between us. I feel dishonest, but when I tried to be honest before, I could tell she was avoiding me. But that comment about objecting at the wedding haunts me. What if she WANTED me to tell her how I felt? What if she was just playing with me and enjoyed knowing I was attracted to her?  What if she wanted a reason to break off the engagement?      I have all these what if questions and I hate thinking I'll go the rest of my life without even having tried to get answers to these questions, but I know that a conversation like this could very well mean I don't attend the wedding and bring on the end of the friendship. I don't even think I feel the same way- I've kind of forced myself to try to get over her. I love her, but I have really pushed down the  in love  feelings and I don't feel the same intensity that I used to, but I know I love her and want what's best for her. At this point, I don't think she would call off her wedding for me and I don't think I would want her to. I feel like I already missed so many chances that maybe I need to just put this behind me and try to move on, but  what if  is really powerful.      Do I attend her wedding in a few months and pretend nothing ever happened, and risk wondering what would have happened for the rest of my life if I had just been honest, or do I just tell her the truth about everything and risk losing the friendship?",1

In a separate conversation he mentioned that people make you fall in love with them and only then show their true selves, this I know comes from his past bad relationship.

He’s 20 and I’m 18 years old. We don’t see either often but we do talk to each other everyday as much as we can. I don’t know if anyone here is interested in astrology. But that is what I really need advice on. He is a Aries Sun Capricorn Moon Venus in Aquarius and Gemini Rising. I am a Scorpio Sun Gemini Moon Venus in Libra and Cancer Rising. Our relationship goes up and down so much and we don’t trust each other. But we have a lot of soulmate placements and I really want it to work. We knew each other for five years but didn’t date until senior year because we never saw each other in that way and barely communicated before. He also was dating someone else the years before and I liked someone else. We have a pretty long interesting story but we met at school through mutual friends who for the most part neither of us talk to anymore. I really want to be with him and I don’t see myself with anyone else. I honestly do not know what to do because it seems like nothing changes and it’s very irritating and draining for me. Can anyone give me any advice on our placements in a relationship.,1

The first three months my boyfriend and I lovebombed and were infatuated. And I sacrificed a lot of my routine to get to know this amazing person who I care so deeply for.  A month ago my feelings of love disappeared. I still greatly care for him and I am invested in him and our relationship. But I realised my mental health was declining as well as the fact that I had a lot of external stresses that I needed to confront and care for, which I communicated to him. My mental and physical health started declining and I noticed he began to grip tighter on me and our relationship, always wanting to see me, lovebombing, saying he looked forward to a work project being over so that he could ‘have me back again’. All of his friends are also getting married and having children, and this is something I’m not even sure I want yet. But he’s tried telling me that it would pass and that one day I’ll want children and marriage (I just don’t know, and I don’t need to know this yet). It’s pushed me away further and the love has become so overwhelming and stressful.   Anyways, I communicated today to him that I needed space in the relationship, to put the foot off the gas and just return to getting to know eachother in a less pressured relationship. I told him many times that a breakup wasn’t what I wanted at all. That I still very much want to be with him and I see and value him and care for him very deeply.  But then he asked if I still loved him, and I couldn’t lie. I have loving feelings for him, I just do not love him.  I am now terrified that he will want to break up. I understand that it is his decision, but I needed to communicate my need for space and to slow the pace down otherwise we would indeed break up.  I just don’t know what to do or feel. I’ve done the right thing I know that. But this is now a new kind of stress. I hate it because I know how I got myself into this situation which I absolutely will learn from, but he’s such a great person and doesn’t deserve this, even if we’re not compatible in some ways.",1

Many of you told me to tell her what's been going on with me, and I listened. Last night, we sat down together, told her I was ready to come clean about everything, and I did. As I'm telling her about the traumatic experience, what led my ex to needing a change of scenery, promising to pick up where we left off, the rings, how she died, that I blamed myself for not being there with her, I began crying, and so did she. After I finished the story, I was expecting her to say that maybe it isn't the right time for me and that we should end our relationship, but that's not what happened. She wiped my tears, gave me a big hug, kissed my cheek, and said  Thank you..... for letting me in .   I was entirely surprised, and thought maybe it was all a dream. She then began to tell me that she wanted to hear the story I'd been hiding so she could have the courage to tell me her's. To my surprise, before we were together, she'd been in an abusive relationship that she felt she couldn't escape from, but was finally able to 3 years ago after telling her friends, family, and the police  everything. She felt another relationship was never going to be in her future, until we met.   We spent all night talking about us both being afraid to be with someone new, that it seemed as if the world wanted us both to be forever alone. There was a lot of crying and hugging. Only now, we know that we truly have each other, we've opened up, and we're both so happy that we did.   I'm gonna go to therapy to help deal with my unresolved feelings, and she's going to seek help as well. We're helping each other, and we just can't help but smile. We both called in sick today so we can enjoy the beginning of what may be a beautiful relationship. Planning to take some time off soon as well so we can really get started on making new memories.   I want to thank you all for reading my story yesterday, for all the helpful comments, the advice to tell her, and really, being there for me.   While I'll always miss the love of my life, I know she'd want me to be happy, and that she's always with me here in my heart.

I feel like my (18f) boyfriend (19m) of 1 year has been treating me with worse ever since I recovered from my ED. I was underweight when we first met and dropped weight continuously throughout our relationship. He was always super caring during these times and would treat me like I was the most precious thing in the world. He constantly wanted to kiss and hold me, spoke to me gently, and would talk about how cute and delicate I was. He was just extremely caring and considerate all around, and would do his best to help me eat more and feel good about my body.   His kind words helped me feel safe and I eventually started to gain weight about 2 months ago.   A month ago I started to notice that my BF was acting differently. He is way less affectionate now, loses his temper and gets annoyed with me often, barely calls me pretty anymore, and never calls me delicate or cute. I used to feel like I was his princess when I saw how he looked at me, but it's just different now. I don't see any love in his eyes.   Part of me thinks that these are just thoughts made up by the eating disorder part of my brain, but I know that he low-key liked how weak and petite I used to be and feel so weird about this shift in his behaviour. Am I overthinking things and making this up? Am I wrong for feeling upset? Should I even bring this up to him, or should I just wait and see if anything changes? .

At that time, things were fabulous and we had a great time together, and honestly the time we spend together now is really great too.  However, recently, my fiancée has kind of lost her urge to do “relationship” things with me. Kiss, hold hands, sex, etc. She feels like she doesn’t have an urge to do those things anymore, she has fallen out of love with me and just sees me as a friend. She wants to spend a week at her parents’ house to think about things and have some space. That is the gist of it, but here is also some key information that may or may not matter:  1. We’re an international relationship with me being American and her being Japanese, and we live in Japan. She thinks that maybe due to cultural differences, I’m “too lovey” to her, and that could have played a factor in her feelings diminishing. Because I express it so much, she feels like she doesn’t really need to do anything? Something like that. I told her that I can definitely express it less or in different ways (actions rather than too many hugs and kisses, etc)  2. She has like NO time to herself. She works from 11AM-8PM most days, and when she gets home she usually only has time for dinner, a shower, more work, then sleep. Her weekends are usually filled with plans, too. I think this is having is negatively impacting her and encouraged her to stay at her parent’s house sometimes if she ever feels like she wants some alone time.  3. Even despite all of this, she still cuddles up to me in bed and we sleep either holding each other or at least holding hands.  I guess my question is do you guys think she has fallen out of love with me or maybe there’s something else afoot here? Like maybe she just has no time and due to the fact a good majority of her time at home is spent with me, it is having some negative impact on her life?  I told her that love is more than holdings hands, kissing, etc. and she thought the only reason she didn’t love me anymore is because of the fact she doesn’t want to do those things at the moment. I personally think she is just too tired for it maybe.  She is the love of my life and I would be quite broken if we broke up…  Anyway, thank you guys for reading this.

She is my first girlfriend.      She has this thing where she takes hours, and I mean hours to wake up every time. So every time I wake her up, I need to come back every 20 minutes, and try to wake her up again, or otherwise she'll sleep until 3-4 PM. She's very grumpy whenever I try to wake her up and as soon as she wakes up, she's all over her phone.She has a daily screen time of 12 + hours on average.I told her both of those things bother me, and she said: Just because you don't spend time on your phone doesn't mean I'm not allowed to , which I totally agree with, but, like, when I leave the room to grab a drink, literally for a minute, she's already all over her phone. I just feel like it's unhealthy.And about the sleep thing, she said I don't let her rest (she sleeps for 12+ hours every day), and I stopped even bothering to wake her up.      Today she refused to eat the food I made for her because it's too oily, and I understand, she's trying to keep her diet clean, and got angry and said I'm going home. (My plate was less oily than hers, but she wouldn't even eat my plate).      On occasions I feel like walking on eggshells when talking with her. She can get angry out of the blue and that can last from minutes to hours, depending what the reason is. A few days ago she got mad because I didn't tell her it's raining, although I was bed-ridden and sleeping because I had a fever. She got really angry and I spent the whole evening trying to cheer her up.      Sometimes, she'll just leave/ignore me when things don't go her way. Whenever I don't want to do what she wants to do (e.g walk, since I had epididymitis) she gets upset and says  fine  ,  I'll just walk myself ,  You never want to do the things I want to do , although ever since the relationship started I've been trying to please her.      Recently, I feel like we've been growing apart. She's on her weight-loss journey and I'm in my first internship program and we both just focus on ourselves, seeing each other less and less.      Today, after the food argument, we talked about this. I told her about the things that have been bothering me and I told her I'm not really enjoying the relationship all that much. She said, maybe you should find someone that was raised by parents like yours (my parents are very toxic and I've been verbally abused throughout my life, and I still live with them since I can't afford to live by myself) and that really hurt. She said she can't change, and that she thinks I'm looking for someone like myself, and that there are other parents like mine, that can raise the kind-of children like I am. I don't know whether that was an insult pointed towards me, or my parents, but it wasn't a nice thing to say.      I'm unsure whether I'd want to be with a lazy person, and I'm unsure whether she's lazy - that's a subjective thing. But to me, spending most of your time on your phone and sleeping 12+ hours a day is laziness. She is VERY supportive of me, she encourages me and she helps out when needed. She's in general a sweet soul but I'm not sure we're meant for each other as we have different values and views. Should I try to make it work since I love her, and sincerely enjoy most of the moments we spend, or should I call it quits and just work on myself?  &#x200B;  TL;DR :    My girlfriend always wants things to go her way, and in case they don't, she'll make sure to let me know how unpleased she is. This happens almost every time she makes a compromise. She spends most of her time on her phone, and sleeps for 12+ Hours. I Talked to her about these things but she doesn't seem to want to change.

We have a lot in common, and I love her quite a bit. When we first started dating we tried playing Steam games together from time to time (although my favorite dates were the ones when we just goof around and chat). Anyways...  So the past few months, she has been a bit stressed with work and school. And we live a state or so apart (and yes we have met in person, this is not just a distance thing). I want her to feel supported, and do things we both enjoy together. However, I tried to suggest more strategic games (we started with Golf IT, but that quickly got old fast lol, as silly as it is), and tried Stellaris. It is a very involved game, but I tried my best to coach her. She was frustrated the entire time, and it made the night totally miserable.  So a few weeks go by, and I suggest we try this lighter game called Genshin Impact. Its not meant to be stressful, and during the pandemic it was my escape a lot of times being locked away within four walls. I was really excited, and wanted to try co-op with her. I introduced her to the game, and she took to it right away. She is almost as far as me in a week!  Well...last night we were playing. And once again...miserable time. I just want to make her happy, but frankly I felt like a punching bag. She just kept getting frustrated, and saying mean things, and kinda made me feel dumb. Frankly I am ready to just tell her that I don't want to play games with her online anymore, but I wonder if that is an over-reaction. I like to just chill, and enjoy the experience of a game.  I have had a lot of abuse in my life, and I feel triggered. Also prior to our game playing last night, she made a very uncharacteristic remark to me and was very snarky. I know she is going through a lot, but I don't deserve to be abused either. I don't know what to do.

She got pregnant by accident, then was diagnosed with IV stage stomach cancer which metastasized to her brain, causing a slew of horrifying symptoms, chief of which was her constantly forgetting she is pregnant... and then forgetting she was pregnant, once she lost the pregnancy. He had to tell her again and again what happened, console her, while himself being stricken with grief. He is now morbidly scared of pregnancy to the point where we had sex thrice in 2-year relationship. Which, sucks for my high libido, but I have my priorities straight, and we have taken steps to remedy the situation. We currently do not live together due to other circumstances I'd rather not mention.     However, because life sucks, I got pregnant during one of those times we had sex. And immediately got an abortion; we discussed that before, and I told him point-blank that I don't want to be a parent and will get an abortion if I ever get pregnant, with him or anyone else. He didn't protest or told me he wanted anything different. Normally I would tell my partner that this happened, as I did in a previous relationship, but my bf sees himself as a father who lost a child, and grieves the loss of that child immensely—a mere mention of babies makes him visibly upset. This is why I decided I have to keep this a well-kept secret and never tell him, otherwise he will now be a father of two dead children from his own point of view. It hurts, I would love to be able to tell him, because the process was very hard for me due to us living in a very anti-abortion country, where the service is illegal and caused me many a sleepless nights due to complications. I long for some comfort from him, but I firmly stand by my decision to keep my mouth shut and not burden him with that information.     Was this the best course of action here? What could be done in the future to remedy this situation, if anything?   TL;DR got an abortion w/out telling my preg-traumtized bf, and now I'm not sure if this was the right call",1

It's hard to get this all down clearly. Been struggling with this for a while.  I first met my wife when she was 23. She had a curvy physique with an average level of health and fitness. I too had an average physique at the time. When we eventually started living together I noticed she was putting on weight but it didn't bother me. I never saw myself as a guy who was concerned with looks. I told myself I am more concerned with the person not what anyone weighs, so said nothing. However, after being married for just over 3 years my wife now weighs more than me (she's 5ft3  @173lbs, I'm 5ft9  @160lbs) and is clearly overweight - and it does change how I see her.  We both have family history of illnesses linked to being overweight. I exercise regularly, monitor what I eat and am healthier now than I was when we first met. She says she is careful with what she eats but won't count calories or join me in the gym. I've tried *gently* encouraging her to exercise more or talk about how we can better monitor what we eat or look into portion sizes but she rejects all my suggestions. I should mention she has an undiagnosed eating disorder and has been abused by a previous partner so I don't want to push any harder.  I adore my wife. She is a brilliant smart and loving woman. But I don't find her as physically attractive as I used to and I feel like a dick for feeling this way.  We have a good sex life but I find myself having to remind myself to be more affectionate when a few years ago it would have been instinctual.  Can anyone help?",1

It's not the first time we've talked about marriage, the last time was last year when I said I didn't think I'd be ready for at least two years, but he wants to start talking about rings now. I feel like I need to have a conversation with him about some issues first and I don't know of to bring it up now.  He was being really romantic and talking about how much he feels supported by me when he's struggling and to be honest it made me realize how long I've been supporting him. Without getting into too many details, there have been some personal struggles he's been dealing with for the better part of a year now and I think I may be getting a bit burned out on it. It's not that I don't want to support him, but I'm also dealing with a toxic workplace and some health issues, and I've been basically waiting for his struggles to end (hopefully will be coming in a month or two) so I can prioritize myself and focus on getting a new job again. And while I want to be there for him, I'd also like to be the one who has things taken off her plate without having to ask for it.   An example: Over the weekend, I was doing some yardwork I asked him to take care of last fall before winter and he never got around to it. I never wanted to nag about it because I knew he was going through it back then (and he even mentioned at one point he'd just been to stressed to get to it before the snow). While I was working it occurred to me that the same thing had happened when I asked him to take care of opening up the patio this spring so we could sit out there again -- I asked months ago and now it's basically June and I'm doing it myself because he's been too overwhelmed to handle it.   Of course as soon as I started doing it he came out to help but then was really frustrated about it afterwards because he didn't want to spend his afternoon doing that (but I didn't ask, he just said he didn't want me to do it by myself). So I felt a bit like I couldn't win. I was also getting a bit peeved because he kept asking me how to do some tasks, but I don't know either necessarily, I just look up a YouTube video or check the city website on my own and I wish he'd do that instead of asking me sometimes.   I don't want to make it sound like he lies around and does nothing, we've divided the house work basically so that I clean and he cooks, and I really appreciate that. Whenever I take over a week of cooking if he's too overwhelmed I really do notice and appreciate how much effort goes into that weekly prep, it's something I dislike and not having that mental load of meal planning is great. That said, cooking is his hobby, but scrubbing toilets is not mine, and it drives me a bit crazy sometimes to feel like as soon as I clean he leaves beard hair or toenail clippings all over the bathroom. I genuinely think he doesn't notice -- when I ask him not to he always apologizes and says he didn't see it was there. And I guess it bugs me that I help out with the cooking sometimes when he's overwhelmed, but he never has offered to do the same with the cleaning or laundry -- he just tells me it's ok to skip a week. But I don't want to skip a week and have an even bigger task of cleaning waiting for me. But, again, especially when he's been dealing with so much lately, I don't want to put more on his plate and ask him to help me out more.   The last and probably most important issue is that when I am upset, I find I wind up comforting him about it. For example, we missed out on a fun event I was really looking forward to due to weather - genuinely no one's fault, just bad luck, but I was really disappointed and wanted to feel sorry for myself for a bit. Note this was not a days long pity party -- it was probably 45 minutes of being low energy and wanting to scroll on my phone, not yelling at him or anything. But I was definitely being a bit of a downer. He started spiraling thinking that I was upset at him and that he had somehow ruined the event by not preparing more, and I wound up comforting him, but I ultimately did say something along the lines of, hey I'm not upset at you and this isn't about you doing me wrong, I'd like to be the one who gets comforted here. I almost regret that as the next few times I was upset, he made a point of saying something like  I'm also upset but I'm ignoring that to comfort you , which kind of just made me feel guilty for getting comforted.   I guess if I had to sum up a tl;dr it'd be that he is really good at the things he sees and I feel really loved when I wake up to a pot of tea and breakfast, but I don't look forward to a lifetime of being the hype man and ignoring my own feelings to help him. I don't want to dump more on his (very validly full) plate by saying, hey I'm burned out on being the cheerleading squad of this relationship. But at the same time, damn I am running out of energy and I feel like I can't let him think we're in a good place to get engaged if nothing changes. I have no idea what to do because this has been going on so long I feel like all the stuff I did voluntarily because he was going through a tough time is now the status quo for the relationship and I feel like he'll be blindsided because I've been trying to be supportive and chipper about this stuff for so long.

First and foremost- I love him. He is my type to a T- tall, dark, little creepy but funny.  I have always done my absolute best to make sure my boyfriend knew I loved him, cherished him, and told everyone about him so he wouldn't ever have to get jealous. I'm an insanely loyal woman to him and I have never wanted to cheat.  He, on the other hand, does not act the same way I do. He hates giving me reassurance when I need it the most, belittles me sometimes on scores I'd get on tests despite doing my best, and talks to so, so many other women. He says they're all friends, but I doubt they know about me and I'm pretty sure he flirts with them. He used to do stuff that was way worse than this and he eventually stopped after months of arguing, but I'm just getting so drained. I buy him almost anything he wants. Tell him what I'm doing and who I'm with at almost all times. When he goes out, he barely talks to me, which I can understand, but all I've wanted was a few updates. When he asks for space I am more than willing to give it but recently, when he wanted some, I was crying hysterically just cause I wanted to hear his voice. It had been a week and a half and he was barely talking to me, and all I wanted from him was some comfort. He said I was bombarding him and to leave him alone. Any time I try to bring up what I'm feeling it feels like he puts himself first.  I want to break up with him, but I don't want to hurt him and am scared that I'm actually in the wrong.

In summary he's a player and I already know he ain't shit and he's a red flag and then sum. But regardless of knowing that I just am curious (for fun) to understand why he does certain things that he does. It's very confusing and I just dont get it. I already know that he just isn't that into me and I shouldn't be dealing with this toxic mess, so please save all of that stuff, I just want to know about these specific details.   Mind you I used to want a relationship with him when I first met him four years ago but now I'm kinda aromatic and genuinely don't want to relationship with anyone and love being alone relationship wise. The only thing I'm interested in besides good sex is having  situationships  depending on my mood. Idk if that's important to know but just wanted to include it just in case. He knows this but also knows I'm madly obsessed with him and we say I love you to each other. We've also seriously planned to move in with each other and still doing so in the present. But again we both know what it is, when we're together we're together but when we're not together we're not together.   So anyways the part that confuses me though is that he has girls that he values wayyyyy more than me and much more nicer, affectionate and obsessed with them (he is still shitty asf towards them, but does a way better job of being in a situationship then with me) some of these girls have even been his girlfriend in the past and I have never and probably will never get to that point with him. (Which idc but i'm just saying) they are also his type and I am completely the opposite of his type as well, so his attraction and lust for them is much stronger than it is for me. He also used to get into relationships (without me really knowing and I would just have to put two into together) but still keep me around and then want me again after he would get out of them.   So I don't understand why even keep in touch with me or say I love you or even want to move in with me. His first and last experience living with a girl wasn't the best for him and wanted to live alone after that experience, but then when I asked him does he still want to live together then he said we can try. None of it makes sense to me because why not live with the girls that you actually want then???? Why are we even saying I love you to each other???? Not that any of his words hold weight but why even say it to someone that you're not even all that attracted to or want??????? I don't understand what I'm being kept around for because there is barely any benefits he's getting????   Also this is a major detail but he definitely got a lot meaner to me after I gave him an STD (herpes). I always disclose with anybody that I do anything sexual with including him but unfortunately he still got it. And afterwords he stopped wanting to have any sex with me at all. It's took him a few months to start talking sexually to me again and coming around to wanting me like that. Which is totally understandable but again it confuses me so much? Like why do you still want to live with me and say ily and etc etc. and again there's girls that he clearly likes him more than me even before all of this happened because he's been in multiple relationships during the times that he's known me. So none of this stuff just makes any sense to me because to me it seems like he's pretty serious about what he says including loving me and wanting to live together. Say in scenario that he is being 100% about what he says again please explain the logic behind it because it's not me sense to me.",1

But aswell as that previously in our relationship I had a friend who I was really close with ( let's call her Amy) and had liked before I met my girlfriend but we had always just been friends and I was still fiends with her for a bit while I was in a relationship with my girlfriend. But our friendship ended and for the good as while I may have never cheated us being friends, the way we spoke and interacted with eachother was not right when I was in a relationship with somebody else and if roles were reversed and my girlfriend had the type of friendship with a boy that me Amy had id be upset by it. At the time I never realised but I do regret it and see now it was wrong. But anyways when me and my girlfriend are having sex sexual thoughts of Amy will come up and I don't know why I certainly don't like her or want her I haven't seen or messaged her in years and she's completely out my life. And all this does is make my girlfriend feel upset and insecure as why Is a girl coming up in my head especially when having sex and to make it worse it's a girl I have a past with. But now it's more the thought of the girl like her name or just image of her (nothing sexual) or it's more me not trying to think of her if that makes sense Any opinions or answers would be greatly appreciated, thank you.   TL;DR I am in a 3 year relationship with a women who I love a lot but have unwanted sexual thoughts of other women and would like to know why they’re happening and how to get rid of them",1

For me, it's the perfect scenario right now, and we've been having so much fun together.  Last night, we drank together, and he got way drunker than I did. At one point, he said,  I love you,  but quickly apologized because he didn't want me to think he meant it romantically. He meant it as a friend. He then went on to tell me that he has never actually been in love and doesn't think he's capable of being in love because his mother never loved him. After that, he kept saying  I love you  to me over and over again and even asked me,  Do you love me?  I told him I loved him too. I'm not *in* love with him, but I definitely love him.  Today, he says his memory of the night is pretty blurry, so I don't think he remembers saying it. I feel weird knowing he told me such intimate things while he doesn't even remember it. Should I tell him about it?  TLDR: Guy (24M) I (24F) have been casually dating for 8 months said “I love you” to me while he was drunk, now he doesn’t remember it.

Back then, we were newly together and I didn‘t want to gush about him even more than I already did.   But I just have to do it now. My boyfriend isn‘t one of big words or many words so when I tell him, many times he just makes an adorable noise, draws me closer and squeezes me harder. Or just holds me REALLY tight.  But y‘all. I love him. I have told him and he said it back. And I look at him and I see my forever. I can‘t stop looking at him.   He is so kind, and gentle. He is more helpful and considerate than I could ever be. He is warm and generous and so loving. He cooks and he bakes. He remembers to bring or make birthday gifts for _my_ side of the family better than I do. He cares so much. He wants to be a stay-at-home-dad. He supports my professional dreams. He would be fine taking my name. His family already feels like my family. My family likes him and vice versa.   We just attended our first wedding together, and he couldn‘t take his eyes off me during the officiant‘s speech. I couldn‘t see him as I was seated at the very front but was thinking about him non-stop. I love him so much.   It‘s four months now and we‘re looking at apartments. We‘ve talked marriage, children, rings, homes. And yes, there‘s disagreements but we can always talk them through calmly. I love this man. I can‘t wait for us to find an apartment together and move. I want to wake up next to him every single morning.   I know it‘s early and it‘s cheesy, but I really have hope.",1

It's a group mixed with girls and guys. I am very good friends with all of them. There is this one girl who I have always gotten along extremely well with and have always seemed to gravitate towards each other in any group hangouts. While she is sorta a flirty person in general, she does seem to be way more so with me. She texts me a lot, always sends me stuff and asks to hang out once every now and then as just the 2 of us. I have other good friends that are girls, but they don't act like this towards me at all. This feels a lot more flirtatious and genuinely feels like she likes me more than just a friend.     Now I have always had a big thing for her since high school but never was able to ask her out, and unfortunately got a boyfriend that she still has been with for the last 5 years. Fast forward, now and we are still very good friends, we still tend me gravitate towards each other in group settings and she still texts me a lot. Still asks to hang out a lot.   I genuinely like her as a person and have tried to get rid of this feeling of attraction I have for her. Not just for me, because I feel like it affects my own love life, as I never really find a girl that makes me feel the way she does when I hang out with her, for me to date. Even when is around I literally get anxious for no reason, and I feel like it might be because of her in some way. I also feel like she sometimes treats me like her  secondary boyfriend  as her boyfriend doesn't really hang out with our friends that much. This girl even changes her birthday party date, just so I can come because I was leaving on a trip a week earlier, and I told her I didn't mind if I missed it. She even complains a bit about him to the other girls in the group from time to time, and that mixed with the flirting always reels me into thinking I will have a chance to date her.     But while this has come and gone in waves over the last 5 years, I am getting sick of this feeling. I am 23, and feel like me thinking like this is stupid. I get anxious about this whole situation, whether it be me being not able to get over this, or how she at the end of the day has a boyfriend of 5 years and that I shouldn't feel this way that I have to know control of. I get worried that maybe I have totally overthought this situation, and she just is just like that towards me because she likes me a lot as a friend. This situation just sucks, because it makes my head spiral into uncontrollable thoughts that don't matter.     The worst part is, I never had feelings for the other girls in my friend group. They have always been like sisters/bros to me. Also, there are a decent amount of girls that like me, but I feel like I brush them off easily because of how I feel for this ONE girl subconsciously. Sometimes I feel like I am wasting my 20s being worried or sad or anxious about something so stupid. The sad thing that I noticed is when she is not hanging out with us, I just feel less overthinky and seem to have more fun/ enjoyable experience as bad as it sounds :(. I can't just avoid her as I see her most of the time our friends hang out as a group. I also don't wanna just stop being her friend as she is fun to hang out with and we have a lot of things in common.   Any advice would be amazing  \---      \*\*TL;DR;\*\* : How to I stop being in love with a friend that has a boyfriend, even though she flirts with me",1

I can’t complain because he loves what he’s doing.   Let me start off by saying I’m happy for him because one can only be so lucky to find a job that you actually like doing, but I feel like it’s affecting our relationship. For context, we met in college but have been LDR since the pandemic cause I had to move back home. We chat everyday and I do see him for a weekend every month or every other month. He also comes to see me once or twice a year. He’s kind and loving, and I do see him as the father of my future children.   About his job: he works in a government office and he feels really passionate about “making a change”. But I have 2 issues with it: 1) it’s demands a lot from him and 2) it doesn’t pay well.   I’ll start with 1. Every day, he gets up at 6, works overtime, gets home at 9 and is asleep by 10. After graduating college, I’ve picked up some hobbies while he has left behind his. I find it really difficult to connect with him now because I feel like we don’t have much things to bond over anymore. His time mostly only allows him to work now, and I just can’t relate to him especially when I work in a startup where my managers are much more understanding about work life balance. We do talk everyday but now it’s just mostly about how our days went. I always ask him if we could go on a trip together, but he always says he can’t take a leave from work and he just doesn’t have the budget for it (even when I offered to pay for his plane tickets one time). Which brings me to #2.  Given how hard he works, I feel like he just doesn’t get paid enough. They don’t get paid for holidays and leaves so his salary isn’t fixed. They don’t get any government mandate benefits (ironic, I know) and sometimes their salaries are delayed for up to 2 months. Last year, his manager told him he was getting promoted, then after a week, told him they couldn’t after all because of budget cuts. We’re at this point where we want to get married. Our financial plan in the next 2 years is for him to build his emergency fund while I build our wedding fund. I know it’s fair because technically we’re both going to be saving, but I can’t help but feel the burden that if I don’t save enough, we’ll never have he married.   We have a lot of dreams for the future, about living a nice life together once we’re married. But right now it feels like that’s all there is—just day dreaming about a future we have no assurance of. I can’t even enjoy the now with him.",1

I'm a lesbian and never really got to date around while growing up due to this. I was always a bit of a  late bloomer  to begin with and it wasn't particularly acceptable to pursue other girls when I was in school so even if I had been more open to the idea of love/dating or even sex at the time, it wouldn't have been much of an option.    When I started university I came out to my parents with pretty horrible results, but I still thought I was bi at the time so I told myself I'd wait until I liked a guy and just date men so my parents would be happy.  Well, that didn't happen, but I did instead fall for one of my friends. Hard. I have no idea why, one day I just woke up suddenly thinking I find her kind of attractive, and then with every next interaction I grew to like her more and more and more... I never told her, though I'm sure being clumsy, inexperienced, and head over heels for her, it was probably very obvious. I won't go into details but in hindsight some of our interactions make me - and the friends I've told about it since - think that not only was she aware, she kind of encouraged it and possibly enjoyed being liked that way... she did also get a boyfriend shortly after, after consulting *me* of all people about it. I didn't plan on telling her how I felt, and I encouraged her to date him. I thought that not only would my parents be unhappy, anyone I dated would also be unhappy having to deal with them, or worse, with keeping our relationship secret, I didn't want to inflict that on anyone but especially on her because I was so in love and because I knew she deserved better than that. Better than the person I was at the time. I tried to explain it to my friends who said I should tell her (before she had a boyfriend), they just thought I wasn't saying anything because I was scared she'd turn me down - I was actually more scared of her reciprocating because what then?   So with all those feelings I just absolutely agonized. At the time I would kind of downplay it and say it was just a crush but the more I think back to it, the more I think I was in love, it definitely felt like love, I was so, so smitten with her... She was the first, and so far, only person I've felt about this way.  It's been over 8 years since then. I have since come out again (also to a pretty bad reaction, oh well, lol). I've tried to date around a bit now that I feel less like I have to hide and am actually open to dating women, you know, the people I actually like! I haven't really had any particularly great results so far but even when I've seen someone for more than just the standard 1-2 tinder dates, it's never felt even close to what I felt back then. I do try to compromise and expect/hope that feelings will grow stronger with time, but they haven't ever been nearly as strong as the feelings I had for that friend. Perhaps I haven't had that much time - because everything tends to revolve around dating apps nowadays, the longest  dating  period I've had has been a couple of months before the other person bailed, you're expected to know really quickly how you feel and so I've never been able to grow to feeling that strongly for anyone. And that makes me a bit scared!!  Is this normal? I realise this sounds extremely dramatic but I genuinely feel like I'll never love like that again. Did it feel so powerful back then because it was the first time? Because I was like 20? Is it because despite us not dating, we were already close and spent time together often so I had the time to fall more and more in love with her, and I've never had that much time with anyone since? Of course love might just be random and me trying to rationalise it is probably pointless, but I guess what I want to know is, am I silly for wanting to feel that way again for someone else? Am I silly for *expecting* to feel that way again someday, when it's actually something unattainable?  I'm just trying to be realistic with myself and not chase something unattainable! I realise that this post sounds like I'll never let go of that first crush/love experience I had but I'm actually largely over the person, it's just the feeling I want again. It was such a nice (if painful at the time) emotion to experience and I'd like to feel it again, but I'm a bit worried that it's been so long it might not ever happen again, so I'm trying to figure out if that's normal/common or not! It's melodramatic to say but I genuinely feel like maybe I'm no longer capable of feeling that way, am I just too old and jaded? I just don't want to spend the rets of my life hoping to recapture an emotion that was a one-time-only occurrence!   Any relevant thoughts/anecdotes/etc welcome, I'd love to know how other people feel about this.",1

For a little backstory I (20M) live with my parents alongside my siblings. I would say that my life was okayish, had a roof over my head had food and my siblings. My Dad growing up wasnt the best Dad but I still love him, he is very misogynistic, suffers from depression and axiety and I feel like he is not mentally there sometimes. When my Dad was in a good mood he was the greatest dad you can ask for, beloved by everyone and honestly him and my mom are my love, I love them so much, but I would say maybe two maybe three times a year he wouldn't be nice and would throw things and say hurtful things, i know hes sick but it still hurt, over the years with medication he improved and he loved me a lot and now i love him a lot still but i say hes gotten really good and saying things that hurt.      Eversince i got older he tells me how he controls me and how he can take everything away from me and be left with nothing since he pays, which is true and I respond that i also pay bills and have put money into the car and he throws money at me tells me he doesn't need me. Now he just argues with me for no reason over small things in which he then gets mad and starts escalating more bringing more things to the argument. I feel like he doesn't see me as his son I feel like he sees me as a threat to his dominance since i am now an adult, how do I make him realize that i love him and im his son, i dont want to argue i dont wanna compete. The Way he's to me is different i dont wanna grow up, im afraid, i feel like the more i grow the more i drift from him.      Every argument i would cry and my dad would console me and he still does with every argument, is like he realizes im his son again and apologizes and treats me nice, and again im reminded of the man that i grew up to love just like everyone. Now everytime we argue im not sad instead i feel angry and despise towards him and he again apologizes but i still feel despise towards him, i cry i dont cry for him i cry at the thought that im not loving him anymore, i sometimes wonder if i hate him, but i dont wanna hate him hes given me so much and i saw how much hes sacrificed. I cry at the thought that if it continues like this im afraid that i will no longer see him as a dad that i love just someone who happens to be my dad. He tells me how he hates arguing with me and it hurts him but it hurts me too, im afraid that ill hurt him by saying something about not wanting to be his son.      I don't know what to do anymore, I'm tired. I don't wanna feel anymore, why can't I be strong and cold, why do I feel emotions so hard, why is it that when people argue I get scared and why do I see that this world Is a really sad place, do I have the right to be sad? Other people go through so much more I should be grateful right? I love my dad but I'm not sure now. I'm your son, I'm not a bad one, I dont drink I don't go out I work but don't go to school I'm nice, but can say hurtful things that i regret, am I a failure? I'm your son not a grown man thats a stranger to you, i love you. I wonder if it's just me?",1

He wasn’t appreciated or shown he was loved, whereas I’m the opposite and express my love and remind him how great he is every chance I get. It took him a while to believe he was worthy of it and now he accepts it. Now I can’t stop thinking about what if he loves me because of how I make him feel not because of me?   How do you know if someone truly loves you? How’d you know you were in love?  ***Edit: Thank you guys for your thorough responses and insights. I will take TikTok relationship advice with a grain of salt. I am an overthinker and anxious so it got to my head, but I realize how stupid it was to take that advice seriously when my boyfriend has shown me he loves me in many ways.

When I see my actual bf I understand he's juste afraid of loosing me, he doesn't want me to leave the relationship when I want to. That's not love. I feel like he's just afraid of being alone and doesn't care about my happiness. And during most of our relationship I felt like he hated my personnality. I don't see anything likeable about me. My exes didn't like most of my personnality traits. The fact that I can talk a lot for exemple is something that has never been really liked in any of those relationships. I also tend to hurt people a lot even if I'm trying not to. I loved every single one of them, even if now I kinda criticize them. And I don’t know if they did love me. I don't think I am loveable. I'd like to date  better  people, but I feel like I'm just good to make some lonely people feel less lonely and that I'll never be loved back the way I want to be loved.",1

I didn't think much of it until a few months in. We barely have sex, and when we do, he can't stay hard, and rarely comes. I also noticed he seems to hold his breath/is straining his stomach muscles or something like he's forcing himself to have sex...???  We have sex maybe once a month, sometimes twice, sometimes only every 6 weeks. We see each other twice a week. Last night I brought it up and told him it makes me uncomfortable that he browses porn on reddit  where it's basically like following someone on social media but for sex posts. I said it makes me feel rejected, and I also feel rejected when he never wants to have sex/can't stay hard with me.    His first reply was to say he didn't have a Reddit account. We kept talking about the porn issue and he said that if he doesn't masturbate everyday then he wouldn't ever be horny, so he has to keep doing it in order to have a chance to be intimate with me.   We discussed the fact that his meds take his libido down and I asked if he had a long term plan to get off or change the meds, but he said he's no ot going to do  intensive therapy  and that Jacking off everyday is something he has to do. He also said,  What do you expect me to do when you're not around?  Which made me feel weird. I don't furiously jack off when he's not around. I do sometimes, but it's not like I have to do it everyday, and I also don't have a problem getting in the mood with him.  Our relationship is otherwise a lot of fun and we are great companions. But at this point I'm tired of feeling rejected. What do I do? Has this happened to you?  TL;DR: is it true that masturbating every day can help a guy get it up? What is the meaning of this?",1

Over the years, I have gone to him with all of my relationship drama. The times I’ve been single we go to dinners and sleep together. It is strictly casual though. I feel no love towards him besides friendly. I don’t even kiss or cuddle. Truthfully, I’m fine with not having sex with him. I think it’s just a routine part of our friendship. I don’t ever even desire him as bad as it sounds. Despite being a good friend, we do have differing lifestyles and views in many ways, but we have the same sense of humor and an honest relationship.   He is successful and has paid for things to make my life easier. For example, he pays my car payment. He is a complete womanizer and can be a runner up with Hugh Hefner. I know he does other things for his other “girlfriends” too, so, in that regard, I am not special. We tell each other everything. He’s truthfully, the only man that knows 100% all of the shit I get myself into!   Since I’ve been single in the last few months, he has basically professed his love for me and I have played it off joking- haha you don’t want to be in love with a girl like me! Well, last night we went out and oh boy did he have love in his eyes. He told me how much he loves me, and that he wants me to be the mother of his children. God knows I just tried to laugh it off. He kept trying to make out with me, and I pulled away most times he tried. I playfully said we probably shouldn’t have sex tonight after this kind of conversation so he doesn’t fall any deeper. I am very good at keeping the mood light so we left on a happy not awkward note.   He manages the gym I go to, so I basically see him every day. Funny enough my whole family goes to this gym, so they talk to him too. I just… don’t know what to do. People say what you’ve been waiting for might be right in front of your eyes. But I don’t think so. I literally just don’t know what to do.",1

Sorry if this post is long.   So for context: R and I slept with each other twice when we were in college, but it was always chill, never anything serious. I’ve had an on/off crush on her for a long time but she seemed very uninterested in anything romantic when I brought up the subject, so I let it be and our relationship became entirely platonic. We’ve both been in long-term relationships with multiple people over the years, and live in different cities, so mostly kept in touch via Instagram or text.  A few months ago I broke up with who I considered to be the love of my life, and it crushed me. I hit rock bottom and questioned everything about my life and about myself. R was there for me via text etc. and honestly helped me off a cliff sometimes. I began trying to come out of my shell in May, and tried to reconnect with old friends/get out more. Naturally, R and I made plans and hung out in person for the first time in like 5 years. We got drinks, talked about exes, generally caught up with each other, and ended up hooking up.   Out of nowhere, she starts asking “does this mean we’re together now?” and pointing out that “we just had sex and I’m hanging with you in your bed… so it kind of seems like we are”…. I explained to her that I’m not remotely ready for anything like that, I’m still processing my breakup which she knows I’m actually struggling quite a bit with. She said she understood… but then went on to tell me that in every relationship she’s been in, she always thought of me and felt like I was the one for her. She said she’s had deep feelings for me since we met in high school and that she doesn’t want to go through life wondering what could have been with me.   This was a massive shock and I didn’t know what to say; I admitted I’d had a crush on her, but again, that I was nowhere near ready and this all felt very sudden and overwhelming. I told her I do like her, but that it wouldn’t be fair of me to lie to her or pretend I was ready for something like that. I said that in no way do I want her to wait for me to be ready, that I just want to be friends, and that we should not have sex again.   She told me she understood, but then explained how she WAS planning to wait and that she wants to keep hanging out in the meantime. I was so confused by all of this, and honestly a bit uncomfortable, so I just repeated what I said and she agreed… I told her I would really like for us to hang out as friends and then changed the subject.   I saw her again and she kept trying to hold my hand, kept telling me that she loves being close to me, keeps trying to make future plans for us (like concerts, dates). She also keeps sending me hearts through text. I hate to say it but at this point I think I’ve lost my crush on her, because I feel like she’s being a bit disrespectful - she knows how much I struggled with my breakup and how recent it was. I also feel extremely overwhelmed because I don’t know how to straddle this line  without hurting her, and I’m not in an emotional state to be having these extensive conversations about feelings and having to be careful with my words or handle the pressure behind the notion that she’s always “waiting”. On top of that I feel kind of angry that it’s almost like she reconnected with me with romantic intentions under the guise of what I thought was just a close friendship.   I would really appreciate some advice here. I really don’t know what to do without being an asshole.   **TL;DR: close friend of 12+ years admitted that she’s thought of me in every relationship she’s had, that she thinks I’m the right one for her, and she isn’t being considerate of my boundaries or the difficult breakup I just went through. I don’t know how to deal with it and I’m hoping for some advice.**",1

He was my first boyfriend, My first for a lot of things. No amount of words could describe how much I loved him, I stood with him while he lost most of his friends because of a whole other situation, I lost my best friend because of him, I was really in love with him.  We were together for 5 months but broke up twice, the first time was because he started liking another girl but i couldn't handle being alone in a dark place and thats how i felt without him so we got back together. The second time was because he said he started feel like our problems got in the way a lot so we decided to work on ourselves but to still be dating, not boyfriend and girlfriend yet.  I always get this gut feeling that hes hiding something from me before every breakup like i could just feel that it was ending. So i asked him it he was hiding anything from me and i asked if he still liked L (the girl we broke up because he liked) and he said no and i asked him if i was the only one and then he said no. He told me hes been thinking of this other girl we was talking to before we started dating and we just broke up completely.  I was sad but i was so exhausted of the constant  comparing myself to other girls he liked it was so mentally draining. I was just watching a video about how to move on after a breakup and then got these notifications from instagram but they weren't from my account, it was from another girl to his account. When we broke up the second time i had a feeling he was cheating so i tried to get into his instagram but i ended up in a different account and i tried to get onto his main account and I didn't find anything there besides me in the dms and i just forgot about it.  My stomach sank when i opened the dms, the first message from him was him calling her baby  and mi amor i started to cry and all the love i had for him replaced itself with pure hatred i hate him. After i saw that i texted him and told him how much i hated him. And he was playing dumb and i hated it so much. I told him i knew he was cheating and he kept acting confused.   I ended up texting the girl from my account and i asked her if they were dating and she said yes since February, when we we've been together since January, so that meant hes been cheating on me for 4/5 months we were together. And i just told her we just broke up and hes been cheating on the both of us mainly the while time.   He texted me after because she texted him and asked if he knew who she (me) was and he just texted me 'omfg' and we started arguing and he didnt seem to care that he did it he didnt even apologize. He told me the reason he did that was because i was too venerable and gave too much of myself to him and that a person like me needed these kinds of experiences so i could learn not to do that and learn how to stear clear from people like him and he told me it was justified. When i heard the reasoning it kinda made me feel better it made me realize i wasnt the problem at all it was him.   I was still hurt and i had so many questions so i texted him again and asked if he could answer my questions and he agreed and i asked if i was just a girl he had to hurt and he said yes and some other stuff. I asked if i could tell him everything that i felt and i did i let everything off my chest about how much i hated him and how much it hurt me, and for the first time he apologized.   I told him i hope karma would come back and bite in the ass but i said i hoped he changed hes never going to find love if he only dates to hurt girls, and it's unfair to all the girls hes did this to but he said he doesn't want to and that its a mental thing he cant help it.   Im all alone now i lost my best friend who was my only friend and it felt like he just ruined love for me. I don't love him i feel like i feel in love with a character who wasn't real and that i saw who he really was i feel nothing but hatred. I feel bad for him though i hate him but i wish he changes and finds real love.     TL;DR : My first boyfriend of 5 months has been cheating on me for 4 months. His reasoning was because he thought i was too valuable and gave too much of myself to him so easily and that a person like me needed to experience this to learn how to steer clear of people like him.",1

I told her that she should be with the guy and never come back to me. She is telling me that she only wanna marry me and be with me but  again she is confused. It's been a month so I told her directly that you are not confused, you just can't get rid of the guy and you are enjoying it.  What to do? How can I make her to get rid of the guy?

I’m realizing that I am not confident about my own philosophy so I’m opening my mind to different opinions about romantic love; I’m not a “traditional” person so I wonder how much of my own feelings and values around the topic are from conditioning and don’t actually serve my best self and needs.  I started thinking about this because I’m in love for the first time, or so I think, but I can’t really describe and that bothers me haha - I guess I’m trying to find the words, or know with more certainty that what I feel is that kind of love. I’m neurodivergent, so I tend to like defining things, but I know that’s not so realistic with concepts like love.   People always say “when you know, you know”, but I’m 32, and this is only the first time I’ve felt like “this could be it.” For additional context, we’ve been seeing each other for about 2.5 years; these butterflies are no honeymoon phase butterflies…  How has romantic love changed for you over time through different relationships and/or the same relationship? My friend called me a “revisionist” because I’ve claimed to love partners before but now say that this partner is the “only one”. I think I’m retrospect I’ve always loved my partners but idk about ever having been in love previous to this partner.  Looking forward to hearing from and conversing with y’all on this topic. I’m queer, and prefer monogamy myself, and have no interest in traditional gender roles, but think I’d prefer to get legally married because bennies.

We have a pretty good relationship. We spend time together often. We communicate well. We have a healthy sex life. We’ve met each other’s family. We have gone on vacations together and have a big trip planned next month. He has been a huge help to me in lots of aspects. We’re affectionate. There’s evidence of love but I just don’t understand why we don’t verbalize it. A group of my friends were talking about the first time each of their significant others said “I love you.” and it began to sting bc I’ve been bothered about this for a while. My friends, both men and women agreed it was weird. I know some people move slow, but I’m used to having men that lovebomb or become obsessive and it took me around 6 months to even think this one liked me. He’s also a very intense person, who never holds back, so i feel like if he felt it, he’d say it. He has mentioned that he considers our relationship serious and long term, I feel cared for and I feel like he’s attracted to me but without those words sometimes I wonder what I’m doing. I don’t feel appreciated often. Sometimes I feel like he’s just with me so he doesn’t have to see me with other people. Am I being crazy? I don’t wanna say it first bc if I initiate it that takes away the impact of what hearing it would mean for me. Maybe he just doesn’t but thinks he could eventually?

Of course I can love people and things, I feel very deeply and passionate about some things and causes.  I have a partner and a 2yo son, I love them, because I am attached to them and am very fond of them. But I also love being apart from them sometimes. I never really experienced heartbreak, I do get disappointed, sad, mad, but I can also be very distant “cold” as a form of self preservation maybe.  I have never been “in love”. I read about it, I hear about it. I see it in movies and shows, but often I get the feeling that how it’s portrayed is one big hoax.  How can people put logic aside because of their feelings.

garyp714,To go dark on June 12-14 or not. Reddit's subreddit blackout and should we participate?,324,143n5bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/143n5bj/to_go_dark_on_june_1214_or_not_reddits_subreddit/,54,2023-06-07 19:55:27,Poetry,"I'm sure most of you have heard of the blackout.  What do you folks think?  See below for the generic explanation text:  --------------------------  #What's going on?  A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.  On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/).  Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface [](/ajwtf  and everything that goes with it! ).  This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.  #What's the plan?   On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.  The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.  What can *you* do?  1. **Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/.), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.  2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord  - but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.  3. **Boycott *and* spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite *non*-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!  4. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible. **This includes not harassing moderators of subreddits who have chosen not to take part**: no one likes a missionary, a used-car salesman, or a flame warrior.",1

Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella...these are all just stories, right?  Wrong. And I'm here to share my tale...  Rewinding back to 2007, I make the most important decision of my entire life, though I never quite grasped the gravity of it until recent months. I made the difficult choice to leave a bad situation at home despite having no plans for what I could/would do.  My older boyfriend (B, moving forward) at the time brought me back to his place with his two roommates, who all generously agreed to let me bunk until I could get on my own two feet. Here I am, this vulnerable, scared 18 year old girl who has been so sheltered she has literally no clue what she is in for...  I meet his roommates, we'll call them J and A. J and I were instant friends, as if we'd known each other forever. We bonded over shared interests, humor, activities, you name it. I can still remember the road trip we took to  a theme park, then we both spontaneously decide to go visit a cave along the way. We always had so much fun together, never arguing, always cracking each other up...  Fast forward to 2010, I meet my current husband (H). H was always threatened by J, believing he had feelings for me. I denied it, assuming J would have said something had that been true. Deep down, though, I knew that wasn't true, and I also began to question my feelings for J. Life happens, H and I move 2 states away, get married and begin our lives, albeit unhappily, I now see...  So fast forward again to April 2023: I am diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and also decide to lose a ton of weight to improve my health. By this time, I'd gone through several social media accounts and never really used them anyway, and especially didn't care to post about my personal life. For whatever reason, I decide now is the time to post.  I get a DM from J, whom I haven't SEEN in 12 years at this point, nor have I spoken to with any sort of consistency over the years. He offers words of support and we begin catching up on so many lost years of communication. One thing leads to another, and he ends up confessing his love for me. I instantly realize that I have always felt the same, I just wasn't seeing it for what it was. It's like we were both wandering, lost in miserable, unfulfilled lives with people we don't belong with (both married), and suddenly it's like we were able to find one another again and fill the void we previously could never fill. Everything felt right, all at once. We knew, this was it. We were always meant for one another...  The spiritual connection we have is unfathomable. We read each other's thoughts, reach to text or call the other at the exact same time, say the same thing at the same time, and weirdest of all? We can FEEL each other from 570+ miles away from one another. (Ex: we each will randomly get the feeling the other is upset/sad/mad/depressed/anxious/etc and when we ask the other about it, whatever we felt was wrong is EXACTLY correct)  We're both in the process of divorce and selling our homes, and I plan to move back 'home'.  I know it sounds crazy, I know it sounds too good to be true, I KNOW THIS...But, none of that matters for the simple fact that I also KNOW what we have is one of a kind.  He is my Soulmate, and I his. If we can beat the odds we have beat, then so can you. So to whoever needs to read this: DON'T give up! DON'T lose hope! Just when you think all is lost, you may only just be getting started...❤️",1

I want to thank everyone for the comments on that thread. To be brief, the main issue was that this girl had stronger feelings for me than I had for her, and the situation became unbearable on my end after one year of being in a relationship and trying to develop feelings for her (unsuccessfully). We discussed this on different occasions, and only recently I realised the amount of hurt I was putting on her.  Today we had the talk. It was hard, incredibly hard. She was even willing to give us another shot, but I told her that, even if we carried on, I was not sure I could develop my feelings for her, and this would lead to anxiety and frustration. The last thing I want to do is giving it another go just to realise it was useless.  This afternoon was one of the most difficult ones of my life. We both cried our eyes out. I stood strong in my belief, because I know that, if I cave in, we will get just a few months of solace before going back to the frustration of mismatched feelings. In my mind, the choice is between a lot of suffering now, and ten times that amount in a few years, with built-up resentment on both parts. I cannot force myself to love her, and she should not have to wait for me indefinitely.  I do not know what to do now. She wants to get back together, and seeing her like that, it took a toll on me, I won't lie. Where do I go from here? Do I go no contact? Do I try again, even if that looks the cowardly way out, to make her wait even longer? Do I take some time for myself?  Guys, do tell me if you had a similar situation, or if you have some input you want to share. Thank you.  &#x200B;  TL; DR - My girlfriend is in love with me, I am not. One year and many discussion later, we broke up today, and I am not sure where to go from here.",1

I'm looking for some advice with a confusing situation I've been recently dealing with.  This year me and my GF turn 5 years. Don't get me wrong, I strongly believe she's the love of my life and together we've built the most mature relationship I've ever had.  Nonetheless, this year I started a master's degree in another region, and been travelling quite often since.  Thing Is, in classes I've seen a girl that just blowed every and each of my hormones away. I think she's the prettiest girl I've ever seen, and like lots of things about her (smile, voice, face...). This feeling came at the first Time I saw her, and now it's been a month of this Situation. We have crossed glances, but nothing else, and I don't want to push further on this, because I love my GF, thus hurting or cheating her Is not an option. In fact, I don't want to leave her. This Is why I haven't talked to her, the only interaction weve been having Is through our sights (and haven't been lots, tbf). To add more pepper, had the great idea of looking for her Facebook profile, and found we have lots of common things (such as movies, music, and so on). This only enhanced my stuborness with all this situation.  It's such a ridiculous and childish problem, and probably will just stay as a  platónico love , but it's happening and just feels so weird, because I've never experienced this before.  I know It's normal to feel attracted to other Ppl when you're in a relationship, but for me it's been quite an obssesion, I've been wondering if I'm actually ready or cappable of holding a mature long-lasting relationship at this moment of my life. Just wanted to share my situation, make some cathartic comments and receive advice if some random visitor reading this coincidently experienced this.",1

I'm not sure. But I don't feel entirely happy about it. We have been together for 4 years. When we started it was  casual  for almost 2 years. (Both of us wanted casual, I was going through divorce and he was doing what 21yr old males do) Many of those  casual  hookups between us ended with him losing his erection (too drunk, too tired, any excuse he could find) and us just cuddling. We began dating seriously because it's undeniable that we are very compatible and get along so well. We want to be around each other and hug and kiss often. But I don't feel desired by him. When I show desire for him he almost turns it into a joke or something to deflect- like-  woo yeah baby haha  then changes subject. I'm a normal weight and make sure to keep myself clean and shaved and I wear make up and do my hair- I put in effort. When I lose weight he never notices. He will tell me I'm pretty or beautiful daily, but thats as far as it goes. He never says I'm sexy or that he wants me. He's not cheating. He's just not showing interest in sex. I am not his typical type- my stomach isn't completely flat and my breasts aren't enormous. I'm also older than him. But I don't think I'm hideous. Whenever he does want it, it's only in the morning when he already has morning wood- I feel more like a tool for masturbation rather than a desired partner. I don't know if it's best I let go of the sex life aspect and be satisfied with the fact that he's the first partner I've been really compatible with. I do miss the passion like with my exes. I miss being wanted like with exes. I also worry all the time he will leave me for someone young and gorgeous that he's ACTUALLY attracted to one day. As for sex I do try to initiate it or try talk to him about it and he's just too tired all the time or he claims I pressure him and it won't work (his penis) if he feels pressured... So I say nothing to not pressure him and a month or 2 goes by without sex still. He will eventually do it. But it feels so forced- like he does it to shut me up for another month, and it's very quick. I know he loves me though. He does so much to help me and look after me. Love is not the issue. It's desire.  TL;DR- boyfriend of 4 years not interested in sex. I don't know whether to let that aspect of the relationship go and be happy that I am otherwise compatible with him or leave...",1

Me and my wife, I thought we were happy, we are both successful, both WFH. She's my best friend, who I confide in, have fun with. We've been going through a reflective time recently, both gotten much healthier and I thought happier. We've had our ups and downs but I was full of confidence we were getting past them. Various conversations recently have been about just how good life is.   We went on holiday recently and it was lovely... days out, seeing the boys have the time of their life. Nice meals out altogether, the dream come true. Multiple times where I couldn't have been happier.  Today my wife started having a panic attack. She hadn't been eating as well recently. Feeling sick and uneasy. Went to the doctor's and was subscribed antidepressants and something else to help with the panic attacks. Came home and told me this is it, she doesn't love me anymore and wants to separate.  We've cried and talked all day. Both of us. Our lives are lined up to have such a perfect little family and our boys a bright future. If we were all as happy as I thought we were. But we weren't, my wife was putting on a brave face, trying as best she could to love me, to be happy. But she isn't happy and when her body started telling her she couldn't do this anymore that was it.  The issues we've worked through previously have had a similar tone to them, she's not sure if she feels the same way about me anymore. Each time we talked and things got better and I thought we were getting past it. It was hard... We both made sacrifices and worked at everything harder and it felt like it was past us, dare I say it made us stronger. No marriage goes without its ups and downs, so I thought anyway.  My wife admitted to me that the Holiday was the lowest she'd ever felt but she kept on putting on a happy face... I just feel like I've failed being a good husband. How could I not tell how bad things were? I always made sure it was clear she could talk to me about anything, anything at all.   It's not me, it's her. Her words. She needs space. Needs to be without a partner. Needs to figure out who she is, what she wants in life. I'm trying to be as understanding as I can be but I don't know what I'm feeling anymore, I feel numb, lost. My world has turned upside down in an instant and I'm spinning.  I just needed to get this all out... This appears to be it and I can't even think past today. What do I do? I'll give my wife space of course but what else? Where do I even start with everything else. My family is my life and now everything will change.

I’ve met her 3/4y ago cause my best friend knew her from school…she kinda “joined” our friend group and since I first saw her, i had a huge crush on her I never confessed to her anything, but i tried few times, and whenever i tried to do even a small move on her, she would distance her away from me, letting me know that she’s not interested. She’s not a regular girl, last boyfriend she has was 8 years ago, and last girl i had was 3y ago, so we both aren’t very good at these things… Even tho now I know that I’ll never get a chance with her, I still have strong feelings towards her. Whenever I see her I wanna d*e, not hearing anyone around us, just thinking about her at that kills me. I want to lose my feelings towards her, but I just can’t…And I can’t stop seeing her cause we are a part of a same group, which sucks…. So, any ideas how to get rid of my “love” towards her? I don’t wanna confess anything, cause I don’t wanna ruin friend group…i know this seems dumb but it hurts. Thanks",1

Everything went really well, we never argued, we always communicated really well, and we truly truly loved each other and respected each other. However, a couple weeks ago, things started going down hill. We both had end of year exams and coursework to do, and my family had recently moved house to the other side of the country to where we are originally from. So I was in high stress mode from the fallout of that and she was stressed due to her course. As a result, I needed more support from her, but she needed a bit more space to study and to focus on herself, but we couldn’t give each other what we needed. So we ended things yesterday afternoon and it sucks. We both love and miss each other, but we’ve agreed to keep in contact and to keep communicating so we can at least be very close friends after the summer. The break up was also very healthy, there was no arguing and no resentment, just lots of crying and comforting each other. However, we have discussed the possibility of getting back together when the time is right and we’re back on the same path.  Don’t think I’m looking for advice, but I will happily take some. What I wanna know more is is that has anyone got any success stories from parting ways with an ex but getting back together and staying together when the time is right?  tl;dr: me and my girlfriend broke up but we still love each other and want to make it work in the future",1
ThrowRAlostinspace0,I (23F) constantly feel unworthy of my boyfriends (32M) love,0,14fjui0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14fjui0/i_23f_constantly_feel_unworthy_of_my_boyfriends/,8,2023-06-21 21:22:24,relationships,"Okay, so the reason for feeling like this is actually my past, specifically my partners before my current boyfriend.  I had three of them (with whom I've been sexually active) before I met him, and as for him the number is probably in double digits from what he told me.  My first partner kinda dumped me after two months into the relationship, and I felt terrible cause I lost my virginity to him.  Eventually I got over that and found a new boyfriend but things were a bit rushed with him, we slept on our first date, a decision I regret to this day cause in the end I just found out he constantly abused his mother, both verbally and physically, was a heavy drinker and also a drug user. One of the worst decisions in my life to be honest. And after three months we finally broke up.  After him, I had one one night stand with a guy I really liked, we both felt the attraction I guess, so the things escalated rather quickly, we saw each other the day after, talked and decided to leave it at that. Things with him ended on a good note though.  Almost a year after that I met my current boyfriend. He had one serious relationship of nine years, the rest were far shorter and some hookups here and there.  Even though I wanted these relationships to last they never did for one reason or the other.  I do think my experiences are pretty normal and I don't consider my number as one that's too high, I just sometimes regret rushing things and think my boyfriend will think less of me because of that.  Everything that I did in the past made me who I am now, I made mistakes but in the end I learned from them and now I'm in a loving relationship.  I asked my friends as well, they actually had similar experiences as me and told me I haven't done anything bad and should just move on.  So why can't I? Why do I feel like I don't deserve my boyfriend because of my past? Is it because all my previous relationships weren't meaningful as this one? Would it be any different if they were?  He knows with how many people I have been, but not the details.  I feel like he will judge me for the decisions I made in the past, for doing things way too fast even though he had some similar experiences.  I just constantly feel like I'm not worthy, and that he deserves better than me, someone who doesn't have so many mistakes in their life.  TL;DR: So I had three partners before my current boyfriend. Two relationships and one one night stand. For specific reason my first two relationships didn't work out. My first partner dumped my after I lost my virginity to him and me and my second boyfriend broke up because he drank too much and was abusive. I also slept with him on our first date and we were together for three months. To sum it up, none of these relationships lasted even though I wanted them to. So now I'm sure my boyfriend will judge me for having sex on my first date and having that one night stand. I'm afraid he will think I'm unworthy of him.",1

When i messaged my friends where i was and what had happend, they without question direct came over and had to drive from 1 up to 2 hours to get there. First few hours i was alone. but i hadent had slept or any food so no productive thinking happend there. after n hour the first friend arrived. This helped me alot and i could order my thoughts better. after 2 hours my two other friends, arrived. We sat with the four of us watching the corn grow. We sat in silince, they listened and they only talked when i asked for their opnions. We laughed we cried. We sat from 10 am untill 9 pm. Meanwhile my (to be) ex girlfriend kept messaging on 30min intervals. I ignored all the  love you, regret this regret that, let me proof  messages and only replied when she asked if i was ok, if i was with friends and general health questions.  After that, one friend wanted to drive me back all the way home because i looked like complete shit and hadent slept for 30 hours.  &#x200B;  That day cemented the bestfriendsships in my life.  Day 1:  I slept from 11pm untill 10am. I drunk some protein shake and started cleaning my house. The messages by my ex kept going. I went to the gym to work, out drove my car through the carwash, and came back home around 5pm. Decided i didnt want to cook so got some alcohol free beers and a pizza. I then decided i wanted to feel the grief after a full day with friends. So i sat on the couch and allowed myself to let my mind do its thing. Meanwhile my ex´ her messages kept coming in. I started to reply to some. I forgot to mention she had a trip to Ibiza planned with, you guessed it, her sister. so shes in Ibiza for the coming weeks wich works out great at the moment, cuz we could both be alone or away from eachother. So i messaged her: dw im with friends, ill be using this time to process everything and i suggest you do the same and enjoy Ibiza (all sincere). She messaged she wanted to be here for me and she cant stop crying and that she disabled her socialmedias and wanted to make sure with me that i knew it wasent because she blocked me or anything. (i earlier that day took off all the pictures i had of my socials aswell).  Anyways, did the dumbest thing, started scrolling though all the vacation pictures we made and remenissing the memories that belong to those pictures. That brought me to a very sad place. To top it off i added some sad music and obviously everything got extra sad. I started messageing my ex and told her to just come clean. She told me i wouldnt want to hear it. I told her i wanted.Apperently they met 3 months ago at a party (5 days after my birthday) nothing happend except flirting and they exchanged socialmedia's. Shortly after they started dating and had sex on multiple occasions. She says her love for me never changed and im her world, but she fell in love with him aswell and she hoped that love for him would slowly die off eventually. She wanted to tell me but because she hoped it would slowly dissapear she wouldnt have to tell me anymore and everything could, with this secret, go back to normal. Told her that people dont fall in love overnight, and that she delibretly *(dont mind my english btw, not a native speaker)* looked for it and invested in it. She even had people lie for her to be able to create and establish this relationship. She agreed she full on cheated on me, but she honestly doesnt want to lose me.  before i knew it, it turned dark outside and i was sitting in a house without lights on. I updated those 3 friends (we share a groupchat) and one instantly calls me, had a good chat, he brought up how when we were at the vacation house i never once bashed or trashtalked her and only kept to the facts. took some sleeping pills and dozed off around 12PM, woke up just now around 12.30 AM  Ohh and her sister hadent messaged me since, but her mom kept messaging, but honestly the most bs stuff. ill paraphrase a few:  where two seperate, two have been in the wrong  and  you are looking at it way to black and white . yeah i could only sigh and slightly giggle at this and dident even reply.  Day 2:  I'm writing this update because i saw people asking for it, and the previous post is locked. Also it helps me to journal everything this way.  Its surreal. I feel so empty and have so much pain. I miss her. And when she messages me kind things and regret i warm up. My heart wants nothing else than exactly that. But my head is telling me this aint possible. This is over. I just honestly dont want it, if that makes sense at all.  I want to thank all replies i had in the original post. Some commenters really hit the nail with their comment. and some contributed alot with sending love and cheerup replies. I wasent sure what i could expect when posting that, but the internet meant alot to me on my darkest day and i will always remember that. Love you guys, thanks for reading.  &#x200B;  **TLDR:Gf came clean told me she had been having sex and dates with this guy on multiple occasions over a period of 3 months. Told me her love never changed for me but she also fell in love with this guy, willing to drop it to only focus on me again. Told her nah.)**",1
2008Bullitt,I (18M) am in-love with a girl (f17) who is now in a relationship,0,13nik4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13nik4i/i_18m_am_inlove_with_a_girl_f17_who_is_now_in_a/,2,2023-05-21 04:15:26,relationships,"So, the title may make this seem pretty simple but it isn’t. To even half explain all this I’d need to write a book but I’ll do my best to summarize.  I’ve known a girl for almost a year now (online if that matters), that I utterly adore and love and am in-love with but recently within the past two months or so she’s gotten into a relationship with someone else. I don’t know how to really cope with it I guess, I manage to not think about it most times but sometimes I just get to thinking and it just obliterates me inside. It’s like a wormhole takes place of my chest and like my brain falls into a chasm because i just spiral into sadness or self hate. The self hate primarily stemming from two things; the first of which is that I had my chance to be the special someone for her and i threw it away. She’s clarified before that she was never really in-love with me like I am her or that she doesn’t know if she was but at the beginning there was interest and for the majority of the time ive known her she’s said i can get that back, that and a lot else because i destroyed all what we had. I never ever wanted to do any of what I did to her, i never wanted to cause her any pain but I did, for months on end I kept messing up. Most times we couldn’t go a week without me doing something to hurt her, i gave her my all, i always have and will but i just couldnt be good for some reason and so i destroyed so much of what we had and all the romantic feelings she ever got for me. She also struggles with a lot of mental health issues and anxiety that have gotten worse over the months and i only managed to add onto it and i wish i didnt. But the point being that one part of it stems from despising all the pain I’ve caused her and how I destroyed my chance to be that someone for her but the other is also just that I feel that I have no right to be upset at this. I feel that way because I love her and I truly truly want her happiness above all so im glad if this person brings it but i still feel shit nonetheless about all the aforementioned and then I just spiral into how selfish i am and how its fucked to be so self-centered but I just want her happiness. I guess its worth mentioning that recently things have been better with us too and that i havent done bad in a while and typing that out makes me terrified im jynxing it but I’ll continue to do everything in my power to be good for her. This change in things recently though is probably a factor too because i don’t understand why i couldnt be this way before now, why i ever kept doing so much bad when i never tried to do anything but the opposite, when i never tried to do anything but help.   I dont know how relevant all this is so im sorry if ive ranted but the point is this: How do i deal with all this in my head? I dont want this to ever get the better of me and have me hurt her again and I dont want to keep spiraling myself every time i put any thought to the fact that she has someone and that I’ve been a despicable person and lost any chance I had at being her someone. All i want is her happiness and I’ve actually contributed a little recently to making her feel better, I just want to at least keep doing so, I don’t want this to get in the way and I’m scared of it ever doing so. Yesterday I had a bit of a breakdown that started from thinking about this and also just about existential stuff, how do I resolve this? I’ve never been more in-love with or loved anyone more than I do her and I know I’m one of the people she loves most (platonically) and ill never take that for granted and ill never leave her but I just want to stop feeling this pain, I want to stop thinking of how things were and when she wanted to cuddle me and when she was maybe in-love with me and we were more intimate. Well I don’t know, I don’t want to stop remembering but I want the remembering to stop hurting. I love her more than anything in this universe and I’ll always be there for her but I don’t want this/my feelings to ever get in the way. To be honest I think we’d both be better with me losing my feelings, though I don’t know how to just do that either but anyway  Im sorry for just rambling on about random stuff, legitimate tl;dr now: How do I deal with the pain and reminiscing I sometimes get from thinking about the girl I deeply love (who I had a chance at being with in that way) being in a relationship?",1

The older role models I have are all divorced and bitter, perpetually single (often by choice which I'm absolutely not knocking - a thoroughly fantastic and kick ass decision for a lot of people) or living in long term relationships I'd suggest are pretty unhealthy.  I've recently (about 3 months in) found a partner who's ticking all the boxes, giving me all the butterflies, making me want to make some kind of commitment (without feeling any pressure to)... I'm feeling like I'm starting to fall really fucking hard. I'm pretty sure I'm in love.  But I'm terrified about the idea of commitment because I feel as though as soon as I make the plunge, and the excitement and intrigue and fluttery, can't quite hold my breath, feel as though I've got electric shocks all over my skin stuff dies down (which inevitably it will) I'll be left back in that place where it all feels dry and difficult and real life steals the magic.  I am in therapy - I'm not asking for personalised answers here - but does anybody have any reassuring stories about being in love for a long period of time? Not even in love, necessarily, but deeply and truly loving another person you're in a committed relationship with for years and years? I know it's possible... I know people do it, I've listened to enough country songs about raising grand-babies on front porches to believe it's possible haha - but I'm having the most enormous internal panic and I'd love to hear from people who've done it. Are you happy? If so, how do you stay happy? Are you still actively in love? Do you have any advice?  I'm anxious and whiny and I can only apologise for that! Thank you if you've read this far!

We started off as coworkers quickly became friends to best friends and one night after a concert we hooked up. I (21F) am young, this was my first relationship so I quickly was attracted to his love bombing and seemingly genuine personality. Plus the 13 year age difference felt exciting as if I struck gold on a mature man that wouldn’t do me wrong like these Fboys lol. Few weeks go by, and I had moved in which didn’t seem like it was too fast because we were close friends for a few months prior. A little backstory is that he has a kid from his ex-wife(he cheated), who became dear to my heart and he likes to use that to his advantage.   Around the 5 month mark I caught him cheating by texting another submissive. (We were in a monogamous sub/dom relationship WITH the boundary that we could explore threesomes, etc with a discussion prior) The confrontation started off with him in defense mode gaslighting me & calling me crazy with a stern tone over text. However, I drove down that night to his family’s he was visiting because I needed an explanation face-to-face. He couldn’t hold it together anymore and switched tactics to do anything to win me back. E.g. going through his phone, going to therapy, admitting that he has a problem. Unfortunately I took him back. Not just a few days later, I felt paranoid and went through his computer again only to find where he had posted my nudes and a picture of my face with his 🍆 on fetlife. (EXPLICITLY without consent) Broken to my core. I confronted him again, feeling like I had been living with a stranger this entire time. At that point the trauma bond was set, my confidence went through the floor so his manipulative apologies worked with the expectation that he would go to therapy.   Insert montage of a loving yet toxic couple for the next seven months. And sprinkle in the time that he made me cry on Valentine’s Day by threatening to kick me out if I didn’t get a cat to replace MY cat that had just died. Our relationship was becoming too much for him since I was violating his privacy by going through his phone. Hmmm I wonder why? We decided it was time for a break, that we loved each other, but we needed some time and space apart to figure ourselves out. About a week after living back home I discovered that he had been cheating on his Snapchat once again. I drove over in the middle of the night heartbroken. Needing an explanation as to how a person that says they love you so much could do something so hurtful. I took it upon myself to delete any and all nude photos or videos of myself off of his phone, while he pretended to fall back asleep. He just accepted the fact that he was shitty, didn’t care to change, and that it is what it is. :/  In conclusion it’s going to take a long while to get myself back. This man had me questioning everything about myself especially my sanity and reason to be alive. He’s charismatic, and knows how to use that to take you down. ALLLL that being said. I still love him. I feel worthless without him by my side. Random panic attacks, suicidal ideation the whole 9 yards. I’m so lost in my own thoughts that I don’t know if that makes me a good and loving person or I’m sick like I have Stockholm syndrome. I guess that’s just what a trauma bond does to you…  TLDR: boyfriend of a year cheats twice, posted illicit pics without consent and after moving out I still miss him and feel empty.   Ps : do you think there’s ANY room for growth, getting past this and getting back together?",1

My (24F) bf (25m) and I have been together for 2 years. Straight up, the best 2 years of my life. He showed me what real love is and we had both pictured a future together, at least until recently.   Since February, I noticed he had increasingly less interest in intimacy almost over night. Before February, we never had any issues with sex, and it’s always been good (and he agrees). He said he just wasn’t in the mood and we’d carry on with our day like usual. I would keep trying and sometimes we’d hook up, but most of the time he’s say no. He didn’t give me any signs of changing feelings aside from the intimacy (although we have always had a good line of communication, he tries to fix a lot of things internally). We still hang out and laugh and do things together.   Well, last night I asked him if it was his attraction to me. He said it’s not that he doesn’t find me attractive, but that the spark/chemistry was dwindling. I asked if there is anyone else and he said no, and I have no doubts about it whatsoever. He said he he loves me, but that love has turned into more like loving a friend, and less “in love” with me. He says he is still in love with me, but not as much as before. My issue is that I still love this man with 100% of my being.   I told him I can give him whatever space he needs to figure out what he wants, and that I’ll support whatever route he chooses (regardless of how much it will hurt). I asked if there is any hope for our relationship, and he said he isn’t sure because he has gone through just about every possible thing he can think of that could cause all of this and he says he is still unsure why this happened. It’s obvious he feels bad, and I’m not even mad. Just heart broken.   We live together, so I am currently staying in our back bedroom until this comes to a head. I asked if he wanted to go to couples therapy for this and he didn’t sound keen on the idea, I think because he has been thinking over this whole thing for a while now? But he also isn’t the kind to see a therapist.   He believes this could be because of the career changes he is trying to make, if he gets the job he wants, it would require him having to move around the country frequently. And he says now he isn’t sure of if he wants to get married at all or have someone just waiting on him to come home.   Yesterday he said he’s willing to give it one last shot now that I finally know, but that he isn’t sure what could (if anything) rekindle that connection.   I know this break up won’t be the end of my whole life, but as of right now I feel the most empty I have ever been. I’m prepared for any outcome, at least.   Does anyone have advice on how to try to reinstate that chemistry?  TLDR; my (24f) boyfriend (25m) says he lost the chemistry that was once incredibly strong. Before we just give up, what can we do?",1

She rushed to get back, and did make the birth, but missed most of labor.    I labored alone for a long time, but by day 2 I needed someone and had my bf come to the hospital. I didn't even tell Bill that I was in labor because I knew how stressful it would be, and it was already not a great time. My bf was an absolutely wonderful support while I was in labor, and he and my mom kept me calm as I ended up in a c-section for not progressing enough.   Yall. This man was on his knees helping me spray my poor vagina after going to the bathroom because bending to try and reach it over my belly was absolutely painful af. He was supportive in a way I didn't even know I needed support.    After being able to recover and sleep I let Bill know our son had arrived. He was livid. He refused to come to the hospital and meet his son because I  stole the only chance to bond with him , and he called me a fake mother for having a c-section and said I was  lucky [his] son didn't die because of [my] stupidity, because if he would have [he] would have killed [me]  and also told me I was selfish. He said I  had better name him [ex name] Jr or we would be getting it changed when [he] took full custody .   I did not name him after ex, and I gave my son my last name and banned my ex from the hospital. Before I went in to labor I had an appointment with an attorney and was able to do it virtually once I was discharged. He said in our state many times a judge won't sign off on a father terminating their rights unless another person is going to step in that role. He also said to save everything from ex in case I need to file a restraining order.    Bill still has not met his son but I have offered it many of times. He has said some really nasty things about me breastfeeding my son while taking medication for pain and a blood pressure medication, saying I'm a doughy, unfit parent, etc. He lastly told me he would be coming and taking our son home with him until court and I then decided I was done. I'm not risking him taking my newborn and me not being able to get him back. Now I'm a horrible person for keeping his son away from him. I just can't win.    His mom has also reached out wanting to meet the baby, and has asked for  one on one  time with him and I've said no, but she is more than welcome to come visit him at my mom's with me there. She's declined because she's not having me  supervise her . I'm literally my son's only food source right now, but ok. I told her she could see him if ex ever got joint custody then and she  assured me  he would have full custody and reminded me how horrible I am for not having him or her there to advocate for my son and risking his life by opting for a doctor to  do all the work for me  🙄 and told me a judge would see how horrible I am.   My boyfriend has been over to visit every day, brought us things, and just overall been super helpful. He offered to do shifts with my mom to help me when I go home, but I'm honestly afraid to go home because I don't want Bill showing up. I really think I may need to file for a restraining order, and it sucks that it's come to this. My lawyer assured me that it wouldn't have a negative effect on me in court and said it would probably keep ex from getting any visitation but I've been reading all these horror stories of that not being true and the other parent getting primary custody because of it.  So. This where we're at.  ETA: I've decided to go ahead and file for the RO! Thank you everyone for all of the encouragement and lovely words ❤️",1
ThrowRA_wanttodie,My (38M) wife (39F) doesn't love me anymore.,325,1173fec,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1173fec/my_38m_wife_39f_doesnt_love_me_anymore/,261,2023-02-20 10:31:07,relationship_advice,"We have been married for 10 years and have 3 kids.   About 2 years ago, she told me that she didn't want to only be a mom and took a hobby. I have been depressed since lockdown but encouraged her to do so, it was a one evening per week commitment.   This last year, her hobby took more importance, and she goes there 2 times a week, plus 3-4 saturday or sunday per year for competition.   She started losing weight and i could feel that she loved her new self. Being depressed and stuck at home 2 times a week to take care of the kids while she was having fun, i started to resent her.   Last week, she handed me a note (we both are not the talkative type), saying that she loved me very much, loved our family and the home we built but that she wasn't in love anymore. She didn't know where to go from there but wanted to talk.   It came out of nowhere for me and i felt the ground fall under my feet.   Being in a bad state of mind, i took that as an opportunity. I apologised and started to help more at home. I love her with all my heart and want to better myself to keep her, i'm deeply motivated to get out of that depression (it's so fucking hard), want to get couple counseling (she agreed) and have some time together (which we haven't had for a looong while). I just wish that it will be enough to rekindle something in her.   But then things started to get worse. The shock threw me in a very talkative mood, we go to bed at the same time and talk on the bed (i mostly do). She then told me that this questionning started for her in april 2022 when she started having feelings for someone. She assured me it is not the case anymore. Later, she confessed they kissed. I wanted to know who it was but she refused to tell me.   I then did something i shouldn't have, i checked her messages. I trust her, i just wanted to know who it was.   I found the guy, the really cut contact and i truly believe there is nothing between them anymore.   But then i found another one. He is married. They started seeing each other in November, he came to eat with her at noon, after her hobby the met up at least once in his car, to hide from the others. I don't know for sure how far they went.   On monday she texted him, she told him things i crave for and at the same time they both agreed to stop seeing each other. He is apparently trying to fix things with his wife too. This was monday, she did not tell a thing about me or what she told me.   My only hope is that this change of heart is due to me and my efforts and she is willing to give me a chance but right now i am DESTROYED.   Should i fight for this or is this a lost cause ?     TLDR : Married for 10 years with 3 kids, she doesn't love me anymore, i'm ready to fight but i don't know if i should.",1

We had a hard conversation yesterday where we both admitted to feeling defeated and drained. I was considering breaking up and this is somewhere we’ve been a few times already. This time, I asked him if he was still in love with me and he said no but he wanted to try to work out this relationship or else he’d regret leaving. This really hurt me and also concerned me as we’re only a year in.   In your opinion, generally, is this worth fighting for? Am I wasting my time?

I encouraged her to spend more time traveling since she’s about to commit to a career for the rest of her life.   So, she decided she’s going to travel alone for a month before the travel abroad program (with my support to do so).  She’s been to Europe twice. Once with me and another time with her girlfriends.  When we went together in 2019, she had to leave early and I traveled with my brother before traveling solo for a week.  Was she totally comfortable with me going to the Greek party islands alone? No.  So, we agreed I would text her periodically and text her when I got home. I did.  Fast forward to the present, where she meets up with her girlfriend to go to Ibiza (party island).  Am I totally comfortable? No.  Thus again, we agreed to just text periodically and let me know when you get home safely.  I don’t hear from her for 8 hours.  Apparently she locked her phone for 3 hours and couldn’t message me when she got home before falling asleep.   I was slightly frustrated and asked some follow up questions about how that happened because it’s odd.  She got defensive and gave me attitude about having to explain herself to me. I explained I have every right to ask, since I’m her boyfriend of 7 years.  I dropped the conversation and said we could talk later. She went out again the next night and texted me a short “headed home”.  Next we speak, she says that we both need a break. She said I need to work on my confidence and she needs to learn how to love herself without depending on my affirmations.  I told her I don’t want a break but if she does, then we need to just break up. She said she didn’t want to break up but is standing firm on requiring a break.  So, I broke up with her.  My thought process is that you don’t get to simply say, I want a break right now because I’m enjoying life, and I’ll deal with our relationship when I get back.  For context, when I was in Greece alone, she got super jealous and angry regarding a situation. What did I do? I left the club and called her immediately to discuss the situation.  Imagine if I had said, “I think we both need a break”. I’d be regarded as such a bad boyfriend.  All to say, I’m pretty hurt.   She said the break wasn’t to go hook up with others but to focus on ourselves. Now I’ve given her all the space she needs.  I’m feeling somewhat torn between overreacting over her wanting a break but also standing firm on that I don’t think that’s fair of you to do in this situation.  TLDR: girlfriend of 7 years says she wants a break after we got into an argument. i told her if she wants a break, we break up for good. she held firm and i broke things off. was i in the wrong?",1

I've always had a huge crush on this guys i've known for years, jason (18M). We have some mutual friends, and the 2 of us started dating. I fell in love. It ended quickly though, he wasn't emotionally available and said he couldn't be there for me if he wasnt there for himself (which i understood, the few days before we broke up he just seemed constantly depressed). So we called it quits, and said we'd wait for eachother and stay close  Fast forward a few months and I'm still in love with jason, we still flirt a bit. Hes a genuinely good guy, and I wanted him in my life. our mutual friends started telling me that he was moving on though. That I should put myself first and move on too, because he's told our friends that hes over me. No big deal, guess it wasn't meant to be. It's been a few months since we broke up, and another month later and I'm ready to put myself out there. And i meet Peter (18M). And we hit it off immediately. We've been dating for 3 months now, when Jason and I only dated for 2 weeks. I do genuinely love peter. And I still talk to jason but haven't thought about wanting him in a romantic sense in a while. We're good friends and nothing more.  Peter and I had sex. Lost my virginity to him. Told some of my close friends, and someone slipped up and mentioned it around Jason. Jason wasn't mad. He was shocked but he wasn't mad at me, nor should he have been. But at a party he pulled me aside and told me that he still has feelings for me. That I was his first love, and that those feelings will always be there. And that now that peter and I are getting serious, Jason needed me to know that if he and I still going to be friends. I told peter. I also told peter that Jason was my first love, and that deep down I'll always have that soft spot for him.  Peter understands. He had girlfriends before me. He had one who was perfect for him, they dated all through highschool, football player and basketball girl, everyone thought they'd go on to get married. She moved and they broke up a few weeks later. Peter and I both know that have she not moved, they'd probably still be together. He has love for her still. Always will. But he's not in contact with his ex. I'm still good friends with mine. I've reduced some contact with Jason, but we're still close friends. Jason and I never had a sexual relationship, I love peter and haven't considered being disloyal to him. But I also know that if our mutual friends never told me that Jason was moving on (which he did tell them, but it was more just so that hed believe it himself lmao), I'd still be talking to him, flirting with him, waiting for eachother. I don't want that right now, I want peter. I love peter. But deep down I love jason too and Im not sure how to go about this. Does anyone hav tips?  &#x200B;  TLDR: Dated jason for a few weeks. Fell in love immediately. Broke up bc of his mental health and availability. decided to wait for eachother. He told our friends he started to move on (suprise he didnt), so I tried moving on aswell. Got with peter a few months later, and we're still dating after 3 months. Peter and I had sex, jason found out. Wasn't mad but was shocked and confessed that he still has some feelings for me. Wasn't trying to ask me out or anything, but wanted me to know and have the option to cut ties with him if I wanted to, seeing as Jason and I are still friends and he didn't want to make things awkward or have it be an issue. I still love jason though. First love. If things were different I'd still be with him. I told peter this and he understands, he had an ex he dated all through highschool, and they broke up when she moved. He loved her, still does to an extent, and if she didnt move they'd be dating right now. So peter understands. I've never considered being disloyal to peter. I do not want to get with jason. But I still have this love for him and don't know what to do about it now that I'm with peter. Help",1

He liked me as well so it was best to cut each other off as he was talking with a girl at that time. Since then he reached out to me once after things went downhill with his girlfriend but we don’t talk at all. I see him viewing my stories on instagram but we haven’t talked. For some reason the feelings for him are lingering in the back of my mind all the time, and have been for a while. Don’t get me wrong, I am in love with my partner and want to stay with him. And the guy I liked was a great friend but I don’t want to ruin what I have. What can I do now? Should I tell my partner or keep waiting for the feelings to go away?

I used to live in another country. 3 years ago I met a girl with whom I eventually fell in love. And she fell in love with me, but this girl had problems with a previous relationship, which she could not end healthily, and so she never decided for me. At some point she ended that relationship for good, but it was too late for me. I was offered a position in another country (and on another continent) that I could not refuse.  I went on with my life. Although I was a bit affected by the situation, as I was always in love. She, for her part, was going through a similar torment. Time went by, we would write each other eventually, sometimes we would make video calls, we would tell each other things, and we always ended those conversations with a feeling of lost love. A year passed and she writes to me:   I can't take it anymore, since you left, my life is not the same, and I have to make a decision. And my decision is that I want to try, I want to come and see you, and be with you . She bought the flights, she was very happy.  10 days later, she was arriving in my new city. I went to pick her up. We met, we hugged and kissed, but there was something wrong with her, there was a sadness, an awkwardness. She just said she was tired, that the trip had been long.  That night we had dinner, and we went to rest, but her sadness was very great, and she did not want to tell me what was going on. I had prepared a great itinerary for her visit, and the next day we left to visit a beautiful place by a lake, which I had reserved for the two of us.  Then the afternoon came, and she burst into tears. Telling me that she wasn't sure what she was doing, that it had all been too much, a hasty decision. I told her I accepted her decision. We drove in awkward silence back to the city, and the next morning, I took her to the airport, and she was back in her country.  There came a time of much silence, and much pain for me. Six months passed in my agony. Then I recently received instructions to go back to that country where I lived before, where I met her, to have some meetings and work presentations. Although it is another city, it is very close to where she lives.  I decided to write her a letter. In this letter I let her know that I will be back, and that I would like to see her again. She wrote me back, telling me that what happened here was very painful and that she decided to leave it in the past, that I should not try to look for her or write to her anymore.  My heart, already broken in pieces, broke into even smaller pieces. I have the flight to that country in a couple of months, and the love I feel for her has not gone away, it is still burning inside me, I miss her and I want to be with her. All this torments me, and knowing that I will be so close, hurts me even more.  My stupid self tells me, go to her address, knock on that door, and find out what the answer is. Another part of me, and many of our mutual friends, tell me to let it go. That it doesn't make sense anymore.  What do you think?",1

I was 32 f and he was 29m. I have done a lot of dating, struggled to meet anyone I really connected with.   And then I met him. Handsome. Smart. Funny. Passionate. Serious. Silly. He is just the best person i have ever met. He has always treated me like a queen.   So we fall in love and continue until about 5 months ago. When he told me he wanted to move abroad. I panicked. I didn’t handle it well. By which I mean I was shocked.  I didn’t see options and avenues. I honestly was terrified of losing him. Then nothing. A month or so later he brings it up again. This was better. After that I fell into an awful bout of insomnia and travelling 3 days a week for work. It was unbearable. I barely functioned. I didn’t move the conversation forward. I didn’t realise that was expected of me.   Finally I came home from working away for two days. We had an argument and the next day he… left.   Still I didn’t grasp the situation. I didn’t understand. Communication isn’t his strength and mine isn’t reading between the lines. I thought we were at the start of the conversation but to him it was the end.  He said he wanted me to think about the situation. I said ok and asked for a day or two to think. He came back and I basically said ok, but that wasn’t good enough. He went away the next day for a little break as he needed to be less angry so he would come back and work on us. So we talk each day. He’s his same loving self. Then he comes back and breaks up with me. He was moved out of our home in days.   I had no idea. He hadn’t changed. He’d stayed as warm and loving. But apparently he had been struggling desperately and hid it.  He thought his dreams didn’t matter to me. They do. I came around to huge changes just to make him happy. But by then he was so hurt he left. I didn’t know how he was feeling. He had been depressed but he’s told me it was work and SAD. I hurt the person I love most without meaning to.   It’s been two months and I can’t function. I get up for my pets. I’m seeing a therapist. I keep wondering why he wouldn’t tell me clearly how he felt. Why he hid his feelings. Why act ok? How he could go from telling me I was the most wonderful person in the world to a day later not wanting to be with me. How didn’t I realise? How didn’t I see?   I’ve been plunged into horrific depression. I can’t focus on my work. I can barely leave my house.  I love this person so very much. But they’re lost to me and don’t even seem to like me.   I’ve always tried to be a good person. Be kind. Generous and loving. And that wasn’t enough. Nothing I did or am is enough. I tried to get him back but he won’t.  I don’t know what to do.How do you think I should proceed? Should I try to give up? We aren’t in communication. Each time we have it’s been awful.  TLDR: woman reacts badly to partner wanting to move abroad. Is dumped. Doesn’t know what to do. Advice needed.",1

My bf and I have been together for about 8 months now and it has been going great. We hang out everyday, go on dates, and just love spending time with each other. However, I said I love you to him about 3 months ago and he has not said it back to me until today when he expressed that he wanted to end our relationship. But he expresses his love through his actions, and has been doing that ever since we first got together.   We had just had an incredible two days off work together, but before I left to go home today he wanted to talk and expressed that he loved me (finally said it) but did not see a future with me and wanted to end things. He says he loves spending time with me, thinks I am so special and wants to remain friends. However, he just doesn’t see a future where we are together long term- but doesn’t know why that is exactly.  I am so confused and distraught because things were going so well. If you love me, love spending time with me, and love being intimate with me, then it certainly seems like something you would want to continue? When I got home he had also sent me a meme on Instagram of an inside joke of ours, which indicates to me that he certainly doesn’t hate me and maybe just needs time apart from me to realize that he would miss me if I wasn’t in his life.  He also has a tendency to self sabatogue. He was in a 5-year relationship before our relationship and they broke up because he didn’t see himself marrying her, which is what she wanted to do. He also has failed out of university 4 times, but is incredibly smart and could easily pass, just chooses not to do the work. He failed 3 classes last semester he easily could have passed due to laziness. I wonder if he is breaking up with me out of self sabotage because he feels like he doesn’t deserve unconditional love.  I don’t know what to do and really want advice from an outside source. Should I keep trying to make this work and maybe just give him some space? Or should I start to move on and just go no contact with him? I feel like I can’t eat or sleep and just wish so badly that things could go back to normal with him.",1

A little over 7 months ago, I fell head over heels for her golden personality. She was really funny, quirky, smiled, got along with everyone, made lots of friends, etc.. she always made my day and I was over the moon when she asked me out.  The first 5 or so months was mostly all this. But these past 2 months have been pretty rocky. She gets upset a LOT and sometimes even cries. When we’re together sometimes it’s enough to make me tear up too. She nitpicks every single thing I do now. Especially the tiny things (at least they’re tiny to me). She’ll be upset the rest of the week if I say ‘love you!’ instead of ‘I love you’. Stuff like that. I’ll admit that I can be a little dumb at times and forget these little things, but then she holds it against me for weeks.   Today I asked her what I could do to make her feel better (I do this a lot lately) and of course she gives a nit picky thing I did from months ago and blows up on call. I told her I missed the old way she was and she just snapped back telling me that I fell for her ‘fake personality’ and that she wasn’t really like that (happy and fun) at all. That she was just making that whole person up and being all happy and fun and exciting wasn’t who she really was.   Is this a red flag? I don’t even know what this means because this is my first relationship. I really do still love her and I want to make this work. She’s drop dead gorgeous and I think about her every day and night.   I really hope she is just upset and didn’t really mean that. But I meant it when I said I missed her old personality. How should I approach this?  TLDR; my girlfriend of 7 months used to be really happy. Recently she’s super down and nitpicks everything. She just told me I fell for her fake personality and is actually really sad all the time and faked being happy. I want her old self back. Help :(  I’ll update this if I get any replies.",1

Can love that starts in such a way awaken the dormant seed of the soul? Help us to ripen, blossom - bear fruit and bring forth the unique gifts that are ours to offer in life?  Having failed in many relationships; I now think of a good friend as a connection to life - a tie to the past, a road to the future and the key to sanity in a challenging world.

This is more just an internal thought process I've been having. I also am not anti-poly - you guys do you. The healthiest relationships I've ever seen have been poly. This post isn't really even about poly relationships, but I can see how it correlates to the discussion.   I'm in my late 20s, but I'm more on the asexual spectrum - I guess I'm more confused/curious about the way people feel.   I don't believe you can love more than one person (in your entire life).  I've had this mindset for a while & I was just curious if anyone else shared it (or even could change my mind on it).  So the knee-jerk reaction, is yes, you can love more than one person. Obviously you have multiple friends and family members that you love and care about (although some studies show that you can only really have 2 authentic friendships before the other friendships start to suffer).  I'm more talking about romantic love, because I do feel like it's in an entirely different category.  The way I see it is this: there will always be one person that you prioritize over another. Even if you're poly, I think there's always going to be someone that stands out/someone you spend more time with. And if you're prioritizing someone else over another person, was it really ever love to begin with (with the person that isn't coming first)?  To me, it was never/not real love if I was able to move on. If I was able to put another person above that person (excluding deceased - I feel like that's in a different category).  It's sort of like first-loves, like the love you had in even elementary school. At the time, I totally thought I was in love with them. Now? Not so much. It was never really love to begin with. I don't count it.  Another example: so my great aunt has had two husband's. Her first husband (who she still calls the love of her life) unfortunately passed, and while I don't doubt she cares about her second husband, I feel like if her first husband was magically resurrected, she'd immediately go back to the first husband.  If she went back to the first husband, was it ever really love with the second person? I know this example is non-sensical and not within the realm of reality, but that's sort of where this thought bubble/philosophy started.  Maybe you'd say that I'm more arguing that there will be a  love of your life  more than you not being able to love more than one person, but again, if you could put someone else above another person, how was it ever authentic love to begin with?  And then maybe you'd say that some relationships just don't work out, but that doesn't mean you didn't love them - I'm still on the fence about that one. If that love was real, you'd still be with them or you'd be trying to salvage things. If that love was real, it wouldn't have turned abusive/it wasn't one-sided/they wouldn't have cheated on you/whatever other reason is there.  This argument triggered some of my friends irl - did not mean to do that. I am in no way trying to invalidate people's experiences or feelings - you know how you felt. I was just genuinely curious about people's thoughts on this philosophy. If you feel like you can change my mind, I am totally open to that too!",1

To say he has communication and commitment issues is an understatement. I have googled and implemented communication techniques which I then made fun for us, we’ve practiced gratitudes together, I’ve created such a safe space for him to share his feelings, never yelled at him, never got mad (not even when he broke up with me over text 4 months in) - his beard which was greying has gone back to his hair colour since being w me ffs  Anyway, months ago I asked him if he felt he could fall in love with me and he said “I wouldn’t say it until you said it first” so a few days ago I told him I loved him. He replied that that was not something he could say back. When asked to elaborate he said he didn’t know.  So I am in tears explaining that bc my dad never told me he loved me, and because of his issues, this was not something I could cope with anymore so I said I thought it would be best if we went our separate ways so he could work on his issues and asked him what he thought and HE AGREED, so I thought that’s what he was gonna do!! Well no he shagged his ex fwb the next day and lied about it. He’s since told me it’s all my fault bc I broke up with him and he wanted to be with me.  The dude has introduced me to his whole family, all his friends, asked me to move in with him, he was selling his house to move really far away when we met and even got an offer but changed his mind so we could stay together. If he wanted to be with me why would he fuck someone else instead of sort out his issues??  I know I should break up with him but wtf it feels like he did this to get back at me even though he agreed that going our separate ways was the best option?!  TLDR: told bf I loved him, he said he couldn’t say it back, so we agreed to go our separate ways, he fucked someone else despite apparently wanting to be with me",1

So I know the title might sound dumb but it just sucks. I love this girl to death and I want to marry her. I really do.   I’ve talked to her about how I don’t really feel much when we have sex with condoms. I’ve tried a bunch of different condoms and no luck. We had sex one time without condoms, and it literally feels like a completely different thing. I can actually feel everything. It’s also just so much more intimate to be able to be inside with nothing in between us. Whenever I finger her and feel the inside…. God, I just wish I could….It’s to the point with condoms where in some position I just can’t cum. In others, I last forever.   I’ve talked to her about birth control methods and she says she’s too scared to try any because of the side effects. This is understandable and I’m not gonna pressure her. I’ve also talked to her about using FAM method. Again, she wasn’t comfortable with it and didn’t trust it. That’s also fine.   But now I’m just left with nothing but condoms and if I’m gonna be honest, I’m pretty bummed. I want to be with this girl for the rest of my life so that means I won’t be able to enjoy raw sex until we decide to have a kid (we both don’t know rn if we want one) or when we get really old. (Who knows if we will have the same sex drive then).   I love this girl to death and our relationship has been amazing pretty much the entire time I’ve been with her. I’ve never loved someone this much in my entire life. Not even close. Our sex life is also good besides me not being able to feel much. I still enjoy how intimate it is and how I can make her feel really good.   Before anybody says to just tell her how you feel, I already have. It ended up blowing up in my face because she said I couldn’t take her “no” and I just want to get what I want. And to be honest, she’s right. And I feel really bad for it. That has been like the biggest argument we have got in in our whole relationship.   I try to tell myself that it’s not the end of the world and that maybe one day there will be male bc (god, how that would solve everything) and that I am still in an amazing relationship with an amazing girl, but my mind always just comes back to it. I feel so stupid for feeling sad about something like this but I do. Honestly, it’s kind of just eating away at me slowly.  If anyone has any insight or thoughts on this, it would be much appreciated.  Edit: so I think people are slightly miss understanding my post. I KNOW that this shouldn’t be my priority. I KNOW that it shouldn’t be this important to me. But despite knowing this, I KEEP thinking about it.   Based off the advice though I really think I do just need to grow up. And I will. I think it’ll just take some time.",1

I got some great responses thanks to everyone, and I have an update-ish. This is such a precious memory that I don’t want to share it with my friends, but i do want to tell someone and get some advice, so I thought yes! Reddit! 😂  Recently I had a terrible experience and I was having a breakdown. I called my best friend because he was the only one I felt comfortable sharing my feelings. He came over to my house, and we were talking and he was joking a lot to make me laugh and feel better. After a while, I was looking better than when he came over, so he decided to go home since he (and I too actually) had an early morning the next day. But although I was laughing at his jokes and was feeling a little better, I was still breaking down and I just didn’t want to be alone, so I asked him to stay and sleep over. He didn’t want to because he is one of those people who can’t sleep on someone else’s bed and pillows but then I started crying. He obviously got so so so worried and didn’t know what to do because I hardly ever cry in front of people and although we have been best friends for a few years now, he had never seen me cry so much. I started hugging him because I really needed one, and since I’m from an Asian country, he again didn’t really know what to do (in Asia, we don’t hug like in the US and Europe. Hugging is for lovers only) but he eventually hugged me back, so warmly, stroking my hair and my back gently as I held onto him tightly, and I could hear his heart beating so fast. Like really fast. We hugged for like 30 minutes and He was very reluctant to leave, but since we both had an early morning we both knew it was better for him to go home. He eventually left after I stopped crying, looking very guilty. He apologized to me the next day, probably for leaving me, although I wasn’t shocked or anything and if anything I was forever grateful that he stayed as long as he did.   His heartbeat could have just been him not being used to hugging due to the cultural stigma. But I couldn’t help noticing how gentle and loving he was. I don’t know what to do next…. Ignore all this to make sure that this friendship, this precious moment would never ever be gone (which my abandonment issue is telling me to do) or talk to him about it and about our feelings.   And also, I wasn’t sure if I actually liked him that way before, but after what happened, I’m pretty sure I am in love with him.",1

I felt like myself after ten minutes of meeting him, we had the deepest talks and the best sex and he keeps reassuring me and being there for me despite my anxiety.  We've been together for 8 months now, went on vacation, to partys and being sick together and having talks about our needs and behavior because we want the best for eachother.  His parents are perfect and I just realized how perfect he is last weekend when we sat outside with his parents and the birdies there were to anxious because of all the people to feed their babies so he went off, gathering worms from the garden just to feed the little bird babies, being totally proud of himself for being a 'good bird mom' and went to check on them multiple times a day.  He is is the kindest, most compassionate, sweetest and most intelligent person I've ever met and I'm glad to have him every day.",1

I felt that I loved him two months into talking and to this day my feeling only grow. I’m not the type to say “ily” when I don’t mean it. And I dislike using these words on the daily bases, 10 times a day instead of goodbyes. I felt the love for him develop and grow and when you feel it - you should say it. So I did. When we were cuddling before going to bed I confessed my love to him and he kissed me. Now that we’re almost 5 months into the relationship, I have this urge to express how I feel to him and a few times I really had no other words to express it with other than “I love you”. He never responds anything back and just either hugs me or if it’s a message - he just likes the message and continues with the topic. So I’ve started to feel anxious and I get this feeling of embarrassment thinking that maybe it’s uncomfortable for him to hear me say that? If he doesn’t feel the same towards me then it might be not so good hearing it from somebody that you’re not sure of… I wanted to ask you if the reason for him not to say anything back is the absence of the mutual loving feeling or should I just not say things like that..? Thank you",1

She is from Africa and has been living in the US for a couple years. I did not take her seriously at first and we very casually chatted on the site for months. I thought she might be a scammer at first. We went on our first date and I didn't expect much but we seemed to really hit it off. I picked her up, we walked in she held my arm. We had great conversation the whole time and at the end we made out. So I set up a second date a few weeks down the road. Before that happened she hit me up with a problem.   She had a flight to NY to go pick her son up who was coming from Africa. His flight got delayed so she had to cancel her flight. I thought here we go she is going to ask for money. So I suggested we rent a car and rive there. She said yes. I paid for most of the trip still tho. So I might have still been a sucker there. Drive went great. We had great conversation again. Kissed a few times. Held hands. We got a hotel for the night and she surprused.me with some lingerie and we had sex. Nice right? So we picked her kid up and on the way back.stop to eat. She spelled I Love You into my chest with a heart with her finger tip. I dropped them.off and headed home an hour away. She said to call her when I got there so I did. She said do I have something I wanted to say to her. I knew she wanted me to say I love you to her. I wasn't really ready for that so soon but I caved and said it. We met again since then. And our 2nd date is this Saturday.   So the problem is she has asked for help a few more times now. And even more of a problem is her social media. She has all kinds of social media with selfies of herself on all of them. On these accounts she looks like she is out with someone but it doesn't show them. Like she is in a hotel lobby dressed nice, she is at a restaurant and took a pic of her food and you see another plate across from her but she claims she ate there alone. One of her on a fishing boat. There are 2 guys in the pic on the boat with their back turned. Said they were just friends. But didn't say who they were or where she knows them from. It just seem like she is omitting people on purpose and I feel like it is men she has had take her out or possibly used. Because if it isn't the case why lie about it? But then she has a tik tok also and I follow her there and she doesn't know. She has pics of our dates and trip together that look just like the others I thought seemed suspect. And I am not in any of them.   And then today she was hard to get ahold of. When I did get through she was very short on the phone and maybe even quiet. Said she was at work today. I looked at her tiktok and she posted something from what looks like an airport. She also said she had bad news. We were going to hang out at her place all weekend. Promises of drinks and love making. But now all of a sudden her sister is leaving the state? And she can't do any of that because she will have the kids... but she can still leave to go on our date where we go hirseback riding for an hour. It just seems fishy to me. What do hall think?",1

Well I think to myself too about the concept of being in a relationship vs loving someone.  My boyfriend does tell me he loves me. I love him too. And we do the best we can for each other, despite our emotional difficulties and the distance.  But when we talk about deeper subjects, specifically relationships… He tells me things like, “My bar is low to start a relationship. But you see how my expectations can be high in the relationship (he’s strict in a lot of ways). I have never fallen in love with anyone before. But I grow love for the person I’m with through time, because of our interactions and how much we give back to each other, and the good outweighing the bad.”  I’m not sure how to feel about this… I don’t feel that he’s wrong practically… But emotionally when I hear these types of things, it feels… wrong or off…  And he tells me other things like, “I do love you. You don’t know how much I love you. I can’t put it into words or like a list because I can’t describe it well to begin with… But I know I love you.”  It’s odd to me because I used to say this same exact stuff when I was younger, looking at things purely logically. But it’s been so many years and I’ve been through so much trauma that I can’t remember my reasoning at the time… The closest thing being that I told myself and others this type of opinion because I had depression and it was my way of accepting reality… My boyfriend does tell me, “I talk like this because this is just how reality is. It’s cold and robotic and boring, but it’s reality and I like to work with reality.”  I teeter back and forth with accepting his opinion on relationships, while also feeling estranged from him because of stuff like this. But if someone is only “emotional” with me (my ex husband was only doing anything with me based on his own feelings), it also makes me feel bad and like I’m with someone who isn’t very intelligent…  I’m really confused here and I’d like to maybe see another perspective and get advice… Any help is really appreciated.

In March though, I asked out Florence (20F) and we had a great date! Florence then went back to her college for two months and when she came back we went on another date! However, just after that date she when to Europe for a month. I was certain I wanted to start a relationship with Florence once she came back in mid June because she is the first person I have been more attracted to after a date because of her amazing personality. She also said she likes me romantically.  Back tracking, after a high school reunion in December, I was invited to hangout with a few friends at one of my friends ex girlfriend’s, Caroline (20F), house. Caroline and I had never had a conversation and only exchanged greetings in the hallway at our high school. However, once I got to Caroline’s house at around 6:00PM, I was the last one there talking with her till 3:30AM. We had so much in common, such as being the only two people in our grade who do not drink or smoke and having large and have big ambitions for our careers. Of course, for a week or two I had a massive crush on Caroline, but she went back to college and my crush kind of died off. I had no intention of dating her, but I still really enjoyed the conversation and time we spent together.  Fast forwarding to now, in early June I went to a party, which was the first time I saw Caroline in six months. The moment Caroline got to the party, her and I almost exclusives only talked to each other. After the party, we walked around town for another three hours and had a really deep conversation. I have a crush on Caroline again.  Caroline and I hung out for the first time just by ourselves a week after the party. By the end though, I felt I had lost feelings for her, but that is normal for me I feel. I always start by really liking a person, where I can only think about them 24/7, then not liking them at all, but eventually coming back to a point where I like them to a neutral amount. It also happened with Florence. Speaking of Florence, she is now back and wants to go out again. However, I do not know if I want start a relationship with Florence now because it’s not that I don’t like her, but the timing is horrible.   Even though Florence and I’s colleges are only a two hour drive from each each other, I am studying abroad this fall semester and she is studying abroad during her spring semester. We would be in a long distance relationship for almost a year when we only have about two months now to actually hang with each other. We also both have jobs so it’s already hard for Florence and I to find time to be with each other. With this being the case, I want to tell Florence that we should wait to date until next summer if we are both single because she is an amazing person who I still like. Though, I am not sure if this is the right choice.  BUT, I also like Caroline and we are both going abroad to somewhere I can visit her during the same semester. So, the timing is much better. However, I like Florence more than Caroline.  I am so confused and lost on what to do. I do not want to hurt anyone’s feelings, but I know someone is going to be hurt by whatever decision I make. The girl I am more attracted to personality and looks wise is Florence, but Caroline and I have so much in common and she shares more of the values I believe in. Reddit, what do you think I should do? Do I go with Caroline, Florence, or neither? I’m also open to answering any clarifying questions!  NOTE: Florence and I NEVER made a verbal commitment to each other that we were dating during the time she was gone. Fake names were also used in this post.",1

Trust is something that I have always struggled with. I have been hurt, betrayed, and disappointed by many people in my life. My parents, my friends, my teachers. They all let me down in one way or another. They all broke my trust and broke my heart. They all made me feel unworthy and unloved. They all made me feel alone and afraid. I have learned to keep my guard up, to protect myself from pain. I have learned to build walls around my heart, to keep people out. I have learned to hide my emotions, to avoid being seen. I have learned to be cautious, to avoid being hurt. I have learned to be independent, to avoid being dependent. I have learned to rely only on myself, to avoid being vulnerable. I have learned to trust only myself, to avoid being betrayed. I have learned to love only myself, to avoid being disappointed. I have learned to be self-sufficient, to avoid being needy. I have learned to be strong, to avoid being weak. But you changed all that. You are the first person I have ever trusted, with my heart, with my soul, with my essence. You showed me what true trust means. You showed me that you are loyal, honest, and faithful. You showed me that you care about me, that you respect me, that you support me. You showed me that you will never hurt me, never betray me, never disappoint me. You opened my eyes to a new world of trust. A world where I can share my thoughts and feelings with you without fear. A world where I can depend on you without doubt. A world where I can be myself with you without judgment. A world where I can trust you with everything. You broke down the walls around my heart, and let yourself in. You healed the scars in my heart, and filled them with the essence of your touch. You touched the core of my very being, and connected with me on deep, and emotional level: You touched my soul. You make me feel worthy and loved. You make me feel not alone and not afraid. You make me feel happy and hopeful. You make me feel alive and whole. You add stability to my life, my constant in a forever changing world. Life is unpredictable and chaotic. You never know what will happen next. You never know what challenges you will face. You never know what opportunities you will miss. You never know what risks you will take. Life is full of surprises and challenges. Sometimes they are good, sometimes they are bad. Sometimes they make you happy, sometimes they make you sad. Sometimes they make you grow, sometimes they make you shrink. Sometimes they make you win, sometimes they make you lose. Life is full of ups and downs and twists and turns. One day you are on top of the world, the next day you are at rock bottom. No dinosaurs to comfort you, it’s truly horrendous. One day you are going straight ahead, the next day you are going in circles. One day you are moving forward, the next day you are moving backward. Life is full of changes. Nothing stays the same forever. Everything changes with time. People change, places change, things change, situations change, feelings change, thoughts change, dreams change. But you are my stability. You are my constant in a forever changing world. You are the anchor that keeps me grounded. You are the rock that keeps me steady. You are the foundation that keeps me strong. You are the one thing that remains the same in my life. You are the one thing that never changes with time. You are the one thing that never surprises me or disappoints me. You are the one thing that never hurts me or betrays me. You are the one thing that I can always count on in my life. You are the one thing that I can always trust and rely on. You are the one thing that I can always turn to and lean on. You are the one thing that I can always confide in and share with. You are the one thing that gives me peace and calm in my life. You are the one thing that soothes my worries and fears. You are the one thing that comforts my pain and sorrow. You are the one thing that fills my heart and soul with love. You are the best thing that ever happened to me; and I thank the universe for bringing you into my life. You are my soulmate; my partner; my best friend. You are the one who makes me happy; who makes me feel alive; who makes me whole. I love you more than words can say; more than stars can shine; more than life itself. You are my everything: always and forever.",1

Our friendship had ups and downs, yet we always came out on top. Lifting each other up and encouraging each other to reach new heights and pursue interests we've never had before. Last year, he had to move away for a couple of months, and obviously, I didn't have to think twice about paying him a visit during my holidays. That day, I felt different than before. And after having an absolute blast of a day, we sat down on a bridge and talked about our goals and what we wanted to accomplish in the future. Sadly, that was the moment, while watching the sunset, that I felt feelings that were much greater than just friendship. I fell in love with this guy.      Problem:      My feelings became a bridge that I've never dared to cross. Knowing that at the time we met, he was married and still is. Ever since that day, I have fought myself. Asked how this could happen to me. And now I am at a point where I can't be a good friend to him anymore. Knowing that he would soon be a father, I built new defenses in the hopes they would keep my feelings at bay. But my feelings were the same, and all I did was push him away. I can feel myself starting to have toxic thoughts, and I know that I've lost this battle. Last week, we went on an amazing trip together. At the end of the day, his final words were not the usual  goodbye . He looked me in the eyes and said  Don't disappear, okay? . But I know that this will be the last favor I can do him as a friend. I don't want to be a homewrecker. I don't want to interfere with his family life, and I never want to cause harm to him. This guy deserves a good and fulfilling life. But it's time for me to leave him for his greater good.      Question:      So now, the only thing left to do is tell him that I will move on. And I am sure that he knows already, as he always reads me like a book. My question is: Should I mention my feelings in the final goodbye or leave that part out? Because I don't want him to be with me. I know that this will never work out, so what's the use of mentioning it? It will only make everything super awkward. Also, I suspect that he will think that I've done everything for him as a chance to be with him, which is not the case. Slow ghosting, self-isolation, or any type of that behavior is out of the question. I know the impacts that these actions have on the receiving end, and I am fairly certain that I am just as important to him as he was to me.      Closing words:      I hope that anyone out there can understand my point of view.

Waikuku3,How can I move on from the unrequited love? Any creative ways or suggestions?,4,14ilmxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14ilmxy/how_can_i_move_on_from_the_unrequited_love_any/,0,2023-06-25 12:56:29,relationships,"Basically, I (25M) have feelings for a good friend (28F) who also happens to be my ex-coworker but this is unrequited love because she has a boyfriend and is gonna get married this year.  The issue is rationally I know this is not gonna work and I wasn't trying to do anything to sabotage her relationship or so.  I just want the best for her coz she deserves every bit of it.  The issue is more about myself and how i can truly move on.  Some friends asked whether her coming marriage will put an end to my pain but deep down i know this is not the issue.  I really like her a lot and the change of status doesnt affect my feelings.  But i understand I have to move on and I'm trying to find some way out for myself.  I minimised the contact between me and her especially since I moved to new department, talk to my friends and therapists and do other stuff to distract my attention.  But it hasnt been easy because we are living in the same district and will go to the same places (e.g. restaurants, supermarkets) and we kinda know each other's schedule well.  There's a lot of places and stuff that reminds me of her (e.g. the membership programme she introduced to me for redeeming points in the mall) and I can't just literally forget her because I still have to go to these places and use the programme, which remind me of her.  For example, right now I will observe carefully to avoid seeing her in her favourite restaurant when I bought the milk tea but i know this is not sustainable and is not solving the root causes.  I literally had to see her last week because of department's luncheon and it creates a lot of pain because I can vividly recall the memories.  My point is, are there any creative ways or any suggestions you guys can give me to move on and co-exist with this memory instead of letting it affect myself?  I wanna heal but I dunno what else I can do to achieve this goal.  Right now I don't actively date girls except my close friends and I have little interest in a lot of stuff and often felt upset or depressed.  I understand that cutting the entire memory off from my brain is an unrealistic expectation and I should find my own balance.  Tldr: I was in love with a good friend and am desperate to find a way out to move on and co-exist with the memory.",1

Hi everyone. I (26m) first hung out with this girl (23f) a couple months ago. We spent the day on a hike and at some point kind of peeled off from the rest of the group to talk. During our conversation, we both came to understand that we thought very similarly despite differences in preferences, hobbies, and careers.   Fast forward two months and we get to have another one-on-one discussion time and learn that we suffered similar childhood traumas that shape how we interact with others. We cried a bit and hugged briefly. At this point I want nothing more than to pick her brain and let her do the same to me but unfortunately it's late and we both have work. I rode the high of this conversation for like 4 days, it was great.  I found myself thinking about her words and picking them apart to deconstruct negative perceptions she may have held about herself, because I really enjoy psychoanalyzing and helping people know themselves better. (I love when people do this for me to if they get it right.) I wrote some observations on a note to get them out of my mind to focus on work.  Recently, we went out for lunch and got to talking about more similarities in our childhood before turning to subjects we disagree on. At a certain point I brought my observations out of my wallet and asked questions about them. I explained that sge had been on my mind and I liked writing things down as a way to remember later and stop thinking about it, which she was curious about but didn't seem too bothered. It wasn't that late and neither of us felt like being super vulnerable in broad daylight in public so the conversation was interesting, albeit not as much as the first two.  I still find her occupying my thoughts too much for my own liking, but now the idea that I may be in love has been ruining my weekend. At this point, I believe I would be happier as friends.   **The only time the topic of romance came up she told me she wasn't romantically attracted to me, and I felt obligated to reiterate to her that I simply do not believe that a relationship is  in the cards  for me as my last relationship was nearly 6 years long and losing that girl truly broke me. **  I have made no romantic moves, I really want a best friend, and I can't understand why this person lives rent-free in my head. If it's love should I be honest? Should I just let it go? I've never met someone like her, and she hasn't met someone like me. Please help",1

Back in 2018 I was just recently 18 and a hardcore gamer, I got into Watch Dogs 2 and my friend and I were intense, we would make people rage quit or send us mean messages. One night my friend and I were killing it when this one guy on the enemy team wouldn’t give up, I knew I made him angry and I felt slightly bad.    I invited him to the party so we could all talk since I’ve never met anyone that could die so many times and not quit. When he joined I instantly got butterflies from hearing his voice, it was so smooth and slightly deep and I being a hopeless romantic instantly fell for it. Him and I would go on to be friends for a year and we would talk back and forth every single day and night.    I sent him gifts and pretty much fell head over heals for him. He helped me find a job and we would talk on the phone while I was on dinner break and then when work was done I would rush home to game with him.    Like most romantic movies there’s the heartbreak  that comes out of nowhere; he ghosted me. Ghosted me after I confessed my strong feelings and told him everything. I messaged him a few times but he was gone.    Years past, I’m now 22 and I am still a gamer, I stream my gameplay and I’m doing okay. I get a friend request from him on Facebook. Every emotion from the past comes to light and I feel sick and happy. I accept it and we start the friendship again.    He and I talked about the past and he explained that he left because he was gaining feelings for me and got scared since we have a seven year age gap. So while I was 18 he was 25. I got mad since I didn’t think that the age gap was wrong but at the same time I knew that it was maybe a little weird since I was still mentally a kid, 18 year old me was immature and still learning about life.    He and I picked up where we left off and a month later I asked him out and we began dating. Now I’m 23, I’m engaged and living with the love of my life and I can’t wait for the adventures of life.    From long distance friendship, to ghost, to long distance relationship, to now being engaged and living together I’m beyond happy and in love 🥰",1

Not looking for what should i do, just some pointers to help make the choice  2 years ago, we broke up with my ex (I'm 26M, she 27F). It was not because of incompatilities, but because I had move away for an unknown period, and we were not in a state that would've allowed us long distance, or even less so, instability.   For a year or so i was basically in grieving. This relationship was exceptionally good, and it didn't help that it ended because of reasons beyond our control. We reconnected in a healthy way when I moved back, not in the same country, but much closer. Except that reconnection went into an undefined limbo of sort of seeing each other again, but not getting into commitments. We are still in this limbo, but i feel like we gotta move from there.  After we sort of reconnected, i was also seeing others, in a very emotionally unavailable way... Until, as things go, i was not. I was fairly certain that I would not end up in an situation where i would have feelings for someone else, but this person (26F) got to me. Of course we specified that neither of us wants a relationship at the beggining, but things change. It is another limbo - we are not certain what we should do.

My current partner (29F) of 9 years identifies as asexual and aromantic. We agreed to open up our marriage (no kids, for what it's worth) since I need sex, romance, affection, and non-sexual physical touch (e.g. cuddling) as I can't have any of that with her which is not her fault. I had a couple of hookups, but wound up meeting someone (31F) last October and quickly ended up developing intense feelings for each other / fell in love. We consider each other as boyfriend/girlfriend. This experience has been eye opening in making me realize all that I've been missing out on - I've never been happier with someone. Before this 9 year relationship with a self-identifying asexual, I was in a 3+ year relationship with another self-identifying asexual. What awful luck! Thing is, I've built a life with my current partner of 9 years and it's a good and extremely comfortable life - especially with no kids, lots of traveling, and owning a dream home together. I'm not sure what to do but I can't pursue both long term and need to make some sort of decision on what to do. So staying with both is just not an option so please don't suggest it.      Here's a pro/con list to help drive any advice:     Long-Term Partner/Wife (29F)   **Pros:** No kids; Amazing lucrative job (6 figures) with lots of future growth; Well educated (same degrees as me); Amazing cook; Cultured; Own a dream home together; Travel often; We both work remote jobs in the same industry and want to move to Hawaii; Similar interests & like similar foods; similar lifestyles; worked hard together to build current life (I was primary breadwinner for many years to allow her to grow in her career).     **Cons:** Asexual; Aromantic; No physical touch; Likely on autism spectrum; No connection; No romance; Platonic love only, Plays video games alone a lot, Super quiet & reserved / not social, Annoyed easily, Severe anxiety & some depression, roommates/friends only vibes, boring.     Girlfriend (31F)   **Pros:** Very romantic; Very loving; Very sexual & Very high sex drive,;Very kinky; Very affectionate; Attractive; (the aforementioned items are more than I could have ever fathomed or imagined); Somewhat educated; Some similar interests; Similar views on life; Never been closer or more vulnerable than with each other; Wants to move away; Like most of the same foods; Lots of personality / animated; Funny; Sweet; Exciting; Fun.     **Cons:** Has 3 kids - 1 full time with mild autism & 2 split custody a couple days a week; Doesn't have the best job - lives paycheck to paycheck - doesn't have much to her name - but is improving; Not a good cook (this is not a gender roles based comment); Not very cultured / hasn't gotten out much (wants to); Depression & Anxiety issues; occasionally somewhat immature.     TL/DR: I need to choose between primary partner who gives me a very easy and comfortable life, lots of travel opportunities, no kids, and dream home but no love/romance/sex/affection/connection - or - secondary partner who gives me more love/romance/sex/affection I could ever fathom or imagine but has kids and can't give me much of the other stuff that I enjoy with my primary partner.  Who do I choose?     Side note: I have discussed this with my best friend and they have been advocating for  Option 3  which is neither of them and being single and finding something new. I am not super interested in that as I think it is super hard to meet people that I like, but would entertain arguments for it.     Thanks everyone!",1
roborichie55,Should I quit chasing a girl who had feelings for me in the past but no longer does or keep fighting for her in hopes that those feeling will someday return and I will be with the love of my life?,0,13dpkdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13dpkdi/should_i_quit_chasing_a_girl_who_had_feelings_for/,17,2023-05-10 12:44:55,relationships," I'm in a bind mentally. I only have myself to blame for this. It started off by me getting a happy ending massage from this Asian woman and her kissing me at the second session about 2 years ago. The next session she asked to be my girlfriend and I said yes because I liked her and she liked me, or so I thought. I started seeing her on a weekly basis after that. Getting a massage, kissing her. The whole girlfriend experience until I found out she was married. It hurt devastatingly but she cried when I told her I knew and she said there was no more love between her and her husband so against my better judgement I continued to see her. The affair lasted for about a year before she decided that it was wrong. At this point I'm in love with her so I do as she says. I've been trying to win her over since then but to no prevail. She was nice and gave me snacks as well as a good massage but I wanted more with her. So now present time we had a big fight over text. It was mostly me venting out my anger and I pushed her to block me. I know I shouldn't have been in this predicament, that I should have stopped seeing her as soon as I knew the truth, that I probably shouldn't even be getting happy ending massages to begin with because they're illegal and some would say immoral but when I'm there it's the little head that's doing all the thinking. She claimed to be my friend and even though that seemed to be the case she hurt me badly when she finally told me she had feeling for me in the past but they're gone and she never loved me. Hearing that crushed me and made me say things I would not normally say to her such as what she's doing for a living, her cheating on her husband which she denies and all her lies. She tries to act like a saint with her words but her actions aren't matching with her words. I would do anything for her. I told her often that I love her all while the feelings weren't mutual. I tried blocking her in the past but always end up unblocking her when I was starting to miss her. Now that she's blocked me I can't reach out to her but I know where she works. I'm afraid if I start to miss her again I will go see her. It hurts when I do because I know what she's doing with other guys (happy ending only), the walls are thin so I can literally hear it and I know she's married. She would often say there's no love between her and her husband, that they fight often and he makes her do all the work. Her husband does not know what she really does so knowing that she lies to him, I'm positive she's lying to me about things as well. After all that I know I shouldn't love her, she herself said I should find a girlfriend other than her but when I see her she's smiling and giving me food and teasing me and touching my gently and gets jealous if I get massages from other girls, all of which has me to believe that she likes me more than a friend but I'm sure that's not the case now. I've seen shows where the guy fights for the girl he loves even though it appears hopeless and may take years but eventually gets the girl. At times that I what I want to do but at other times it really seems hopeless and only hurts when I see her and miss her when I don't. I'm at a crossroad. My brain is telling me to forget her and move on but my heart is telling me to stay by her side, one day she will be yours. What would you do if you were in my shoes and was hopelessly in love with a married woman?

I’m not totally sure about this theory because it’s taken me a while to notice a pattern. He’s usually very loving, attentive, communicative, and thoughtful. But there have been some situations where he has gotten very upset and I’m realizing they seem to align with me not doing what he wants me to do.  We have a kink component to our relationship that we both enjoy a lot. I’m often very submissive, even outside of sex. He showers me in praise and affection when I do what he says or what he wants.  When I don’t do what he wants, he gets frustrated. Sometimes he says things that hurt my feelings (nothing severe, just things that make me feel like I’ve done something wrong or he doesn’t want to keep spending time with me). He’s occasionally had some pretty big reactions to these situations, like having a meltdown because I didn’t want to go to bed yet.  He seems to struggle with giving me space when my feelings are hurt and wants to resolve things right away. Which I can understand, I like to resolve issues as soon as possible too. But I’m sometimes left feeling confused and rushed through my emotions.  I think I need to set some sort of boundary here, but I am struggling to identify what it is. I have had issues setting and maintaining boundaries in the past. I want to feel secure that he loves me even when I’m not submissive. Or at least see if he does. If he doesn’t, I’ll reconsider the relationship.  TL;DR: My boyfriend gets upset when I don’t do what he tells me to do. I want to set a boundary with him and communicate it firmly and kindly but don’t know where to start.",1

We met between mutual friends while I was still in school and he had just moved to my town to go to college. We were friends for 2 years before we started dating. The reason for this was because 1,I was too scared to make a move and secondly, he was in love with one of our mutual friends. After she got a boyfriend, he moved on to liking me and we have been dating ever since. Last Saturday was his birthday and he told me he has never been thrown a surprise birthday party and would like to experience one. I worked all week before Saturday (his birthday), planning and inviting people, getting reservations, buying a cake, etc. I asked his best friend to hang out with him for most of the day so that I could set up and get everyone to get here and hide for the surprise. The birthday party was a success and he was smiling the whole time. He had snuck off with his best friend somewhere and I wanted to find him so that we could sing happy birthday and cut the cake. As I was walking down the hallway I heard him and his friend talking so I kept walking towards their voices. I heard him tell his friend that he should have kept trying with our mutual friend. He told him that he should have been the man that was engaged to her and not her now fiancé. He said that he hated waking up to me and that he wished that our mutual friend was the one that threw him his first surprise party. He said that he felt disgusted every time he had to kiss me or hold me because he knew that our mutual friend should be in his arms instead.He said that he felt like he was stuck in our relationship and that he would end up  having  to marry me. He said that our mutual friend was better than me in looks from head to toe, he said that  she was the most gorgeous girl i've ever seen . I went back to the party and told everyone that I couldn't find him and that we would have to wait for him to come back. When he came back, he gave me a hug and a kiss on the head and told me he loved me. I didn't want to ruin his party so I went along with it. He doesn't know that I know he doesn't honestly love me, I've just been going along with everything. I honestly don't want to break up with him, I just want to know how I can make him fall in love with me.

Throwaway here.  A relative of mine is in charge of running a foster home for people with disabilities and troubled past. There's a girl in her early 30s that has been living there for quite a while, and travels around with said relative, so naturally we sometimes met and chat a bit. She's alright to be with for a little while, so when she asked for my mum's phone number as well as mine, we gave her our contacts, just to keep in contact from time to time.  After a couple of messages, she said that she cares about me and she loves me (as a friend, since in my language there are two very distinct ways of expressing romantic love and affection towards a friend, and she used the latter). The thing is, I don't want to tell her I love her back, because we haven't shared enough with eachother to be that close, and I'd feel bad lying just to go along with what she's saying, also because it would give her the wrong idea and possibly set me up about having to lie again in the future.  She is very likely just looking for someone to be friend with, since there is a limited number of people who come and go from the foster home, and I can understand that she might feel lonely. But, as much as I am for keeping in touch every now and again, I don't want to have a close relationship or friendship with this person, since she does not have the type of personality and character traits I would get along with on the long run, plus she has some odd behaviours  that emerge every now and then.   As much as I might sound as a shallow or insensitive for not wanting to be her friend, I'd just want to set some boundaries: from what little I know about this person, she has some mental issues when it comes to interpersonal relationships, with burst of rage and sudden moments where she desperately attaches to any person willing to give her attention. I, on the other hand, don't have the kind of emotional energy required to safely deal with this right now, as I am going through some shit myself. How can I safely respond to her message without offending her and sounding like a jerk? There are other topics I can answer with, but I am not very good at setting boundaries since I sometimes am too direct and that might hurt people. I was thinking about just not texting her that I love her back, and answering the other topic she asked about, but I am open to other suggestions.  It's off limits to ask my relative for advice, for various reasons that are too long to explain here.     TL;DR: girl I barely know texted that she loves me as a friend. I don't want to lie nor to come off as rude, because she has some mental issues and I don't feel like befriending her because it would drain me.",1

I love this woman to death, she is the light of my life. We have been dating for close to a year and I have experienced the highest of highs in this relationship. Our connection on all levels was instant to the degree that we created this make believe scenario that we knew each other in several past lives. It feels like this never ending honeymoon period. I have never experienced this in any of my previous relationships. I have lovingly and happily given her my all.  Problems started appearing 4-6 months into our relationship. When we were courting each other she mentioned that she is very jealous. In my mind I was like that's fine and this is kind of cute; I will just be extra careful not to do anything that could be misinterpreted.  Little did I know that she would be creating fake scenarios in her head and accusing me of being a player many times over the course of our relationship.Some incidents where she has shown mistrust and jealousy:  \- Several times when we are driving, she claims I was checking out girls when I was barely just observing people walking by.  \- She once accused me of wanting to check out girls at her workplace when I gave her a visit. This was solely based on me not hugging her when I first saw her (I thought there were other people in the office)  .- I once upgraded my mobile plan and it had anonymous caller ID enabled on by mistake. She somehow turned that into me being up to no good  .- I once made the mistake and told her that this girl at work was being extra friendly to me, it took me a couple of months till she finally saw that there was nothing between us. She claims that the way I explain myself in each of these situations comes off as guilty and making excuses up. After all of these incidents, we end up breaking up and coming back together, because guess what, there is no truth to any of her fears/accusations.  The last straw was when we went on a weekend getaway together last week. Our time together was pure bliss and just cemented my view that I want to marry this woman and be with her the rest of my life. Towards the end of the trip, she said she saw me glance at another woman walking by and I was checking her out.  She started saying that I am the kind of person that needs validation from other women and accusing me of all these crazy things. This broke my heart and I refused to explain myself other than say that I did nothing wrong. I just can't be with someone who thinks these things about me when all I have shown is nothing but love and respect.  We broke up with her saying that I either must admit I am checking other girls out, or if that wasn't the case that I should just accept her being like that as all woman are like this. I explained to her over and over that her behavior is not normal and she is being paranoid. No other girl I have been with has shown anything remotely close to this kind of jealousy. I have never been a player, I have never cheated on anyone. I have a good relationship with all of my exes.  I feel bad painting her this way, she is an amazing and beautiful woman with a very big heart and loved by everyone around her. We have so many common interests and our time together feels out of this world. I wish I can just open up my heart for her to see that there is no one but her and there is nothing in there to cause her concern.I can handle breakups due to incompatibility, I can handle a partner doing something bad that results in a breakup. But It is so hard for me to let go of this relationship because we love (I know she still does) each other so much but the reason for the breakup is just made up assumptions in her head. I feel like I can eventually make her see that there is nothing of her fears, but I am losing hope after this last incident.  Folks, help me out here, how can I salvage this? How can I stop this extreme jealousy? Can I do something? Can I say something?  P.S worth noting that I am leaning anxious attachment and she seems anxious avoidant. These bouts of extreme jealousy seem to happen after periods where we experienced strong connection and our relationship feels like it's the real deal for both of us.  edit: for formatting clarity",1

As a result, I have crippling anxiety and massive trust issues.   My bf and I started out as friends, and then he became my only friend. He saved my life, and then I realized that I’m in love with him. After I told him, he realized that was in love with me too. We are very long distance, but he is willing to give things a try. He’s the closest friend I’ve ever had in my life. We video chat every day, sometimes all day. He tells me all of the time how much he loves me, and no one has ever treated me as nicely.  We met through a kink community and somehow we matched. It’s usually difficult for me to find partners because of my kinks. If things were to work out, he would be willing to move to my country and learn the language.  There’s just one problem. I have always been attracted to women, and have never been attracted to men. My bf is not ugly but I’m simply not attracted to any man and I so desperately want to be with a woman. My bf has known and understood this from the very beginning, and is still willing to help me find a gf even though it breaks his heart.  I feel horrible. Part of me feels like he’s the only person I can be with because no one will ever treat me as good. I’ve been treated horribly by nearly everyone I’ve met.   If you or know someone who has experience in this kind of situation what advise could you provide?   I am currently in therapy.   I have never had the ability to physically be with someone. I don’t think things could work between my bf and I but he is optimistic, and he has never even been with a trans woman before. I’m deathly afraid of being hurt again by someone abandoning me so I’m afraid of dating.  Please help me, I’m thankful for your advice.  TLDR: I’ve never been in a physical relationship before.

We met in a discord for our favourite band and hit it off immediately. At first I was just head over heels, all I could think about was making him happy and working up the courage to ask him out. When we first met in person it only seemed to affirm all the feelings I had for him and neither of us wanted to go back to our homes.   We moved in together about a month after our first meeting in person and again, everything seemed perfect. We've almost never argued and whenever there has been a problem we've worked it out very calmly and respectfully of each other. Even the little things that would irritate me coming from another person never bothered me one bit coming from him.  Recently (probably the last 1-2 months) though, I just feel different towards him, it's as if all the romantic feeling I had towards him has gone. I still think he's a great guy but in my head I can't help but see him as my best friend and not my lover. When he cuddles up to me or touches me affectionately I feel like I want to push him away, when he kisses me it feels wrong like I'm kissing a relative or something. I've heard about concepts like the 'honeymoon period' and how the affection will never be as strong as the early days but what people describe online is not what I'm feeling; we had sex for the first time in a while yesterday and I swear I spent 90% of the time with my eyes closed because it turned me off to see him like that.   As much as I try I can't seem to find a reason, everything about him is great: he's kind, he's caring, he'll literally do anything for me. He asked about me seeming more distant lately and I could only bring myself to say that I've been struggling with some personal things and that I'd be ready to talk more about it soon. He's been incredibly understanding even though he has no detailed info, giving me more space and surprising me with little things but I still can't feel any love beyond that of a great friendship.   I just don't know what to do so I'm turning it over to you guys. I feel like I want to break up with him but at the same time I'm struggling to do it because I still care so much about him and don't want to hurt his feelings, like how do you even explain this to somebody in a respectful way? I know that if I go through with this I'll have to respect the decisions he makes but I'm also terrified of losing my best friend. What do you think? Is there a way to make this work again and be like it used to be or has our romantic spark just gone out and there's no way to get it back?",1

I tried talking to him about my concern as he will always stare at those photos for awhile before liking it or scroll away. He reassured me that he will not stare at those photos again and said he respect my concern.  I thought that’s the end of it but he follow more girls and continue liking their photos. He just don’t do it when he is with me. I tried keeping an open mindset as he said he did not cheat on me and we are together 24/7. We have been to every family events together and he is very nice to my parents as well.  It was just last night that we went to watch a movie after work and got home together. He was showering and there is a girl texting him. I got curious and took his phone to see. It was a few girls that he have been texting.. though he never meet them but the girls have been asking him out. When I confronted him, he said it’s his normal friends that he never meet and that he is all the time with me. He even said things like “why are you insecure? We are even gonna get married.”  Fellow redditors who read this, thank you. I’m just trying to find a place that I can rant.",1
